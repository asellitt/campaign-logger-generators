    entries:
      - You are at your childhood home. There is a dark disk where the sun should be.
      - You see two castles rise in the distance. One crumbles then another. You turn to dust.
      - You stand above the idle body of your king. The life has fled from his eyes.
      - You are a child. Your mother scolds you for playing with fire. The city burns around you.
      - You and your party stand on an altar in the earth plane. Your metal gear quickly turns to rust. Your mouth fills with dust as you try to speak.
      - The sky turns red as you lose touch with your own location. An infant belly laughs; each joyful sound chasing away the light. “All was ash. All was ash. All shall be ash, mother. None shall know sight, father.”
      - Her silken skin glides over your own like the wind over a whisper. It’s too early. The sun isn’t out yet. You turn toward, and throw one arm around her. And then you remember that you live alone. “North now,” she sings softly into your ear. You wake to the sound of someone urging your party to go south.
      - You find yourself squinting against painful, glaring light as it erupts from the hands of a spell caster trying not to become a squid. Behind him, the silhouetted form of a mindflayer dances a jig. “You had your chance,” it mocks, “and now,” arms open wide, “it’s ALL cheese!”
      - A muscled man in loincloth and fur sits cross-legged before a boulder, palms together, head bowed. From behind you emanates a mournful humming. Beyond the boulder, a lush and fertile valley gradually succumbs to a wave of death and decay. Upon the boulder, your own name.
      - Your face is pressed into a neck; you know not whose. Something hot and thick runs down your chin, and drips in such a heavy stream that you can feel it fall. And you can feel their heartbeat gradually slowing. Beyond, a paladin in shining golden armor emblazoned with an image of the sun raises her crossbow, and aims at your head.
      - You always imagined the clouds would part if ever you met a god, but it’s the bark of a tree parting now. An antlered and gnarled faced is revealed, with great stone eyes rolling until they come to rest on you. Its voice is the song of a thousand birds and all the crickets of the dusk. “You won’t forsake me, will you?”
      - You see a scarecrow stood in a field, a white crow lands on its shoulder, the scarecrow then looks towards you and you recognize it as insert random PC/NPC name here.
      - You are stuck in a cage and a shadowy figure paces backward and forwards laughing at you but no matter how hard you look you cannot see their face and you cannot escape the cage.
      - You see that there is a blood red moon, you are covered in blood and howling towards the sky, around you are hundreds of bodies, you don’t know who they are.
      - A person visits you in your dreams and tells you that you must make haste, do not fall beneath the waves, do not let the deep take you, the river fights you, the rain must reverse (turns out they really need the toilet).
      - You look up from where you’re lying to see weeping mourners cast handfuls of dirt at you. Most have their faces covered by veils but among them you recognize people you’ve killed.
      - You feel a faint rocking motion and a cool breeze on your skin. As you open your eyes, you hear a man tell you ‘Hey, you, you’re finally awake…’.
      - You are taking a bath in a public temple, when the walls crumble around you and everyone can see you sitting in a tub, they look confused and angry at you for ruining the holy temple.
      - You open your front door, but it doesn’t open to the outside world, instead it connects seemlessly to the royal palace, and everyone bows before you as you enter it.
      - You are in a city you vaguely recognize. Everywhere you look you can see your friends. They are avoiding you. When you talk to them or touch them, they start to cry mournfully.
      - A wolf and a sheep walk side by side.
      - You walk in the abandoned ruins of the town you’re staying in, all alone.
      - A chicken lays an egg. When it hatches, snakes emerge.

      - As you walk, rats follow you.
      - You walk along a path of very straight edges, and it’s a smooth surface of a material that is neither stone or dirt. You push a strange cart of a metal grate and tiny wheels that want to go in different directions. The path is a strange maze leading through various landscapes of couches, then chairs, then kitchens. Other people wander around the maze too, pushing carts of their own and get into arguments over something called ‘Shower Curtains.’
      - A silhouette is fishing in the distance. They have caught something. A monotone humming is coming closer.
      - A silver dragon sits beneath an ash tree. It looks at you intensely and opens its mouth to speak, but the dragon turns to ash and blows away in the wind (alternatively it could utter something prophetic-sounding but meaningless).
      - While traveling through the forest you see your childhood dog, and it runs into the trees. You chase after it and eventually find it digging frantically into the earth. It finally stops and looks up at you expectantly. You step closer to see what the dog has dug up but just as you approach the edge of the hole you wake up.
      - The dream begins with you inside a church. As you look around you realize it’s the church that was located at the last town or city the party visited. The pews are filled with people wearing crimson robes and jet black masks. At the front of a church is an open coffin and a priest leading a funeral service. You draw closer to the coffin and inside see your own body/the body of the one the party members.

      - The last thing you remember is a deity older than time itself grabbing you by the throat. ‘You shall accept this truth’, it says in a roaring whisper, opening its other hand in front of you. You wake up before you see what was there.
      - You float to the Astral Plane in a river of souls. You make eye contact with (Friendly Character Name) floating by and feel at peace. What you did wasn’t for nothing.

      - You are walking through a dark forest. You hear a humming song echoing all around. It just barely sounds like the measured chanting of a spell.

      - You’re talking to over some dinner and wine in a fancy restaurant. Suddenly everyone stops talking and moving except you. In unison, they stand up if they were not and move outside. You go outside. The sun is fading as everyone around you stares into it.

    entries:

      - 'Soot: A blacksmith’s assistant who works waist-deep in the fires of a furnace, shaping metal with his bare hands. Built of tough, black iron and covered in his namesake. Soot has a rascally sense of humor and loves heat and fire.'
      - 'Babble: An attempt at a mechanical jester, Babble has been relegated to life as a circus sideshow thanks to his repetitive jokes and groaning puns. He was once very fancifully decorated, and painted a faded, once-garish red and purple.'
      - 'Cognate: a wizard’s personal calculator and confidant, dressed in spartan robes and made of oak wood. Cognate has never spoken a word outside of its calculations and yet is the wizard’s closest friend.'
      - 'Sigmund: a warforged designed as a therapist for the unique psychological conditions of warforged who don’t know what to do with their lives after the war. Has a… controversial theory that all warforged are secretly in love with the artificer who made them, but otherwise provides effective treatment.'
      - 'Wheat: built by a kindly old Dwarf Wizard who inherited a farm and needed a companion to make a proper go at farming. Used a LITTLE too much magic in their creation the dwarf was delighted to find Wheat could also summon fey spirits as helpers. The dwarf eventually passed, and now Wheat roams the countryside offering services and selling produce for coin so they can continue tending the farm until they can find the Dwarves next of kin.'

      - 'CC: Surgeon. has needles, scalpel, etc. in his hands, and often tries to ‘mend’ his own skin, despite having none. Covered in needle scratch marks from trying to stitch these imaginary wounds.'
      - 'Pugsy: Originally was a minor design deviation from a line of pugilist warforged. The idea was to create a non-combatant that could safely officiate the underground warforged fighting rings while dodging attacks. Pugsy was such a good referee that people began coming to her to solve their disputes. She has the voice of a domineering grandmother with no nonsense sensibilities. She has a small shop set up like a courtroom where people come to solve disputes that they don’t want in an official court of law.'
      - 'Spout: The last remaining warforged designed to maintain a royal garden that no longer exists.

      - 'Confessionarium Unit XVIII: a mobile church full of religious iconography and pictures, who roams the lands and visits tiny towns and hamlets who don’t have access to religious services. He can preach sermons for different gods and take confessions (and could play them back to their respective priests for absolution).'
      - 'Hawkeye: originally made to survey battlefields and provide some emergency care in the field. He would relay information to his commanders. Nowadays, he can be found helping a bar, mainly by making their house gin called Swamp.'
      - 'Diggs: a warforged of awe-inspiring industrious nature. Despite being built an absolute tank and designed for battle, some malfunction in his programming caused him to have absolutely no love for combat. He instead takes extreme and sincere enjoyment in developmental or construction work. He has had his huge host of built-in weapons he was created with swapped out for a comprehensive set of tools, including basically anything he could ever need. However, despite this, his favorite tool is his simple shovel which he usually keeps equipped as his right hand. Anytime he’s not doing lucrative and masterful building work he travels from town to town- often building new roads as he goes- seeking out what the town most needs and building it pro bono.'
      - 'Cleanshave: a skilled barber and stylist, with integrated shaving razors, combs, and curling tongs. The copper crest on his head is shaped like an over-the-top pompadour. His personality was designed for excellent listening skills: 90% of his conversation is simply rephrasing what others say to him.'
      - 'Groom: this nondescript, featureless Warforged was built to tend to ferocious beasts of war and vicious monstrosities. Its constant companion is a cranium rat it befriended several years ago.'
      - 'Render: this adept Warforged was created to capture the life of a narcissistic noble as a court painter, creating photo-realistic masterpieces of everything, from diplomatic milestones to breakfast platters.

      - 'Rickshaw: a brawny servant custom-tuned for pulling a rickshaw through the city’s winding streets. The athletic build and built-in sense of direction are obvious advantages for this work, but the highly polished precious metals decorating its form make it eye-catching to passing pedestrians, as well as denoting the status of its master when out on the town.'
      - 'Hearsay: this unassuming, diminutive Warforged is uncannily human-like, presenting as an adolescent boy with red hair and freckles. He is most commonly seen in service as a valet or page, always close by but never in the spotlight.

      - 'Bigweld: an entrepreneur and philanthropist whose company provides warforged with products ranging from everyday appliances to spare parts.'
      - 'Buckwheat: Incredibly proficient at farming. He has replaced one arm with a scythe for easier harvesting, despite his large, tall, intimidating appearance (considering the ever-present scythe), he literally cannot comprehend harming a living, breathing creature.'

      - 'Recorder: A Warforged designed to be a chronicler of knowledge. Anything from the social norms of the different species, creating maps, to anatomy of creatures, the Warforged is tasked with writing all of this down.'
      - 'Smokey, a warforged Forge: has a large hollow cavity in his chest abs stomach area that can be superheated with a combo of fuel and evocation magics, making it hot Enough to meat down metals which Smokey can mold with his hands and a retractable hammer into metal wares.

      - 'Tender: an automaton designed to maintain the flora and fauna of a magically protected Glade that a wizard set up as his own private ‘green house’.

      - 'Bobby: Sporting a brightly burnished copper body and a custodian helmet lopsidedly fixed to a large head, Bobby is the only remaining member of ‘the Coppers’, a warforged police force built in antiquity, and the only warforged known to speak in a robotic, but unmistakably cockney, accent. Monitored and updated frequently by the city’s guild of artificers, Bobby is (generally) considered a force for good, although the laws he enforces do date from a couple of centuries ago. Standing at 8’ tall and 4’ wide, Bobby is certainly a force to be reckoned with. However, somewhere down the line (perhaps even in his original programming) Bobby gained a soft spot, particularly for children. When off duty (Sundays; non-negotiable) he can often be seen carrying street urchins’ round on his shoulders and provides them sweet treats with his 1 silver piece per week allowance. Bobby carries a large copper truncheon but is surprisingly capable at de-escalating violence. In the event of conflict, the general result is a swift crack to the head, and the dragging of the offending party to the local jail. Bobby can occasionally be seen playing back old recordings to himself, but it is unknown who or what he is watching; any attempts by the guild of artificers to read these memories have been politely but firmly rebuffed.'

      - 'Poppy: she works as an undertaker and mortician. Her work is without fault, but her bedside manner is atrocious as she speaks enthusiastically of death as aspect of her trade, rather than a tragic affair.'

Townspeople come and go, mostly wordlessly, dropping off items with written task instructions and stacked coins as up-front payment. You don’t ever really converse with Armsy. You trade handwritten notes. Armsy lacks any discernible head and never speaks. There is no empty space on Armsy that hasn’t been used already to add extra arms. Some think a wizard lives inside Armsy. But that would be crazy, right?'
      - 'Scrape: works in the docks scraping barnacles from the underside of ships. She has a pet blue-ringed octopus.'

When he finishes his assigned roads, he goes to the lords stable and scrapes the horse manure from the stables. Endlessly shoveling shit. A large city might employ a squad or more of this model.'
      - 'Hoss: A quadruped model with a horse shaped head, Hoss may not have the overland speed of a horse but has superior traction on steep up-slopes and he never fatigues, so Hoss has replaced equines in some cargo-hauling areas.'

In the distance you can see a stage with a table, and on the table is a feast. You’re now mayor of the town.

      - 'You wake up face down on the street, just outside where you are staying. You don’t know how long you’ve been sleeping on your arms but both of them have gone to sleep entirely and you cannot manipulate either, only swing them limply.'

      - That outfit looks expensive. Shame it’s not helping…
      - Nice hair!
      - I’m so excited to forget you.
      - Why do you have to be so tall? If you had been pint sized at least we could have overlooked you easier.
      - Now was one of your parents an orc or are your teeth just that bad?
      - Now I realize you’re probably an orphan but you cant have lived this long and learnt absolutely nothing in regards to manners.
      - I would kill you but I don’t think the gates of heaven are wide enough for you to fit through.
      - ”Oh, let’s fight the level X adventurers, they’ll die easily” Don’t you think if we were bad at this we would be dead by now. You’re idiots for even trying to fight us!
      - Now there’s a face only an aboleth could love.
      - That’s your big plan? I’ve heard more intelligent growls from an Owlbear.
      - Are you made out of gold? You’re dense, soft, and I’d love to stick a pick axe in you.
      - Wow! You did way better than I thought you would do. That’s great!
      - You’re a really great adventuring party…just not for this quest.
      - Well, wow…that idea is just something…we’ll have to remember that for a discussion on another day.
      - I’m not saying you’re ugly, I’m just saying the beholder refused to look at you.
      - Was that your own idea or did someone write it down for you?
      - You know, I pity your mother. 9 months of effort to bring you into the world, and it’ll only take me a few moments to remove you from it.
      - Don’t bother praying to your gods, cleric. You’re about to meet them.
      - You’re not even worth the mud on my shoes.
      - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Unfortunately, my eyes are all too human in your presence.
      - Did you rehearse that monologue? Oh what am I saying, you probably read it off of that napkin you call a spellbook
      - Have you considered a career as a dung sweeper? You’ve already got the smell down pat.
      - I don’t know what kind of mental gymnastics you did to reach that conclusion, but they certainly could outmatch a trained performer.
      - Are you deaf, blind or just utterly stupid?
      - I’d try to get you back on track, but you’d probably actually get on the train tracks and get killed in the process.
      - I heard that you went in to a restaurant and ate everything in the restaurant and they had to close the restaurant.
      - Sorry, just give me a minute. I’m trying to think of ways to mock you, but in your case they’d be flattery.
      - You butter your bread like an old man.
      - You have the brain of someone who has encountered a Mind Flayer!
      - You look like you’d eat two cakes for lunch.
      - You have the sparse beard of a young pageboy.
      - Agh! What is that horrible smell…oh I see you’ve bathed that layer of mud off today that must be it.
      - Your wit has never been matched. Exceeded, often, but never matched.
      - Did it hurt when you fell from the celestial plane, missed the material, and landed in the nine hells?
      - Could you tell me what god you worship? I see no other reason save for divine luck that your dumb arse has lasted this long.
      - So you’re the one that an Ogre brings along on a date so that he looks better by comparison. I’ve been looking for you on account of a friend.
      - May I suggest you learn magic? I don’t see any other way you could cover up those horrendous blemishes.
      - You’re mother, I’m sure, is a wonderful person. It’s a darn right shame you did t take after her.
      - They say the gods make no mistakes, but you are proof otherwise.
      - I am always happy to have you around. Your aroma is a vivid reminder why I no longer enter Owl Bear caves.
      - Let me guess, you have a great personality.
      - Wow. You really look your age.
      - You are aware that people simply tolerate you?
      - I can explain it to you but I can’t understand it for you.
      - You’d struggle to pour water out of a boot with instructions on the bottom.
      - If I agreed with you, we’d both be wrong.
      - When was the last time you saw someone smile because you entered a room?
      - I’m not angry. I’m just very disappointed.
      - Your new haircut looks so much better than the last one.
      - The foulest place of mine arse is fairer than thy face.
      - You certainly do live up to your reputation.
      - That kind of petty meanness doesn’t become you. Show us you can do better.
      - I envy everyone you have never met.

Each verse is how they helped the party, and how they died is in the chorus: ‘There were Seven Screw-ups in the party in all, One sang with the banshee in the hall and then there were Six Screw-ups in the party in all’ Popularly altered to sing the praises of other unfortunate adventuring groups."

      - "‘The Bawdy Body of Biddy Badee’ – A raucous account of an old woman accidentally restored to youth and beauty. The song makes liberal use of alliteration and plays on words: ‘her newly charmed charms were enchanting enchantment; passing by barracks led to guardsman advancement…’"

      - "‘And All for a Turnip’ – A song best sung as a round. It tells the story of a hungry halfling and his incredible exploits finding a snack."
      - "‘I Eldalië Nairii (sometimes translated as The People Mourn)’ – An Elven Dirge describing the loss of Cyrindes Flestivel, a beautiful and kind mage, to a spreading plague, along with many of her people. A melancholy ode to loss, some have taken it as a representation of the Elves’ sense of mourning for the loss of their brighter world."
      - "‘I Eldalië Snuiiiiii (The last word is used to sound like snoring or deep breathing)’ – A parody of the Elven Dirge ‘I Eldalië Nairii’, the song is of unknown source; it tells of an Elven bard singing the dirge, while the listeners fall asleep from boredom. A sure way to insult the singer of such a dirge, it is best sung with as much false pomposity as possible."

      - "‘Grandma Got Eaten By An Owlbear’ – A Popular song in winter months reminding people that they shouldent allow their elderly ex adventuring grandmother to attempt to wrestle monstrosities."
      - "‘You Can Just Call Me The Gnome’ – A fast-paced, silly song telling the increasing exploits of Hamish McTamish, a fictional gnome adventurer. Each time the chorus is sung, Hamish’s name is lengthened with more titles (the last chorus includes as many silly titles as the singer can think of and can sing in a single breath) followed by ‘but you can just call me the Gnome!’ Although believed to be human in origin, gnomes love the song, and an informal competition has sprung up as to the longest final chorus. The current record belongs to Sprigvill Gaudynack, who (via both her own talent and magical augmentation) kept the last chorus going for three and a half minutes."
      - "‘Callaud’s Pre-funeral Dance’ – A sprightly instrumental air for country dances. If played with a performance check DC 18 or higher, it functions like ‘Otto’s Irresistible Dance’ for anyone not in combat or threatened (i.e. it will make listening townsfolk break out into dance, but not if you are in the midst of robbing their homes)."
      - "‘Long, Gone Galangal’ – A love story told through Gamelan music about an adventurous Chef seeking a rare root in the forest. Instead of finding it, they find the love of their life. The song is quite long, requires a large number of musicians to play properly, and has a happy ending."

A classic of High Orcish culture, now practically lost to time and the collapse of High-Orcish society. The choregraphy is quite energetic."
      - "‘Great-Grandmother Will Enjoy Eating Your Flesh An Orchestral Eladrin Morality Tale from the Far Fey Realms’ – A bold hero cheats and fails to respect the ancestral Mother-spirit.

They challenge a devil, who curses one with a swollen foot, one with an infected finger, and one with an infected lip. The woman with the infected lip’s line is supposed to be sung while holding one’s tongue. In the end, the women win, the devil is defeated, and each one wins more gold than they know what to do with."
      - "‘The Town with No Name’ – ‘I came across a pokey town. Not much going on and curtains all down. I came across a smokey tavern. Not much going on in that pokey town.’ A slow sad song about a old woman that lost her way and found a town not on any maps they brought and only too late discovered it to be a ghost town. (Actual ghost town not just one that was abandoned)."
      - "‘Beware A Human Bard’ – A pseudo-cautionary song about the lascivious characteristics of human bards; the song begins with an Elvish mother warning her daughter, and proceeds through all the more common races into more and more ridiculous warnings (‘Mama Golem warns that he’ll say he likes your rocks, but what he’s really thinking of…’)"
      - "‘The Fall of the Sun’ – A mournful Aarakocra ballad, said to have been written by the first to travel from the Elemental Plane of Air and see a sunset."
      - "‘The Cheese Song’ – ‘Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese Cheese’ A song used by Kenku bards who create melodies out of the different voices and accents they have heard the word in the songs they sing."
      - "‘Glida’s Wedding’ – A traditional halfling travel song, describing the setup for a halfling wedding, ‘held in the shadow of the wagons on a Summer Sunday.’"

      - "‘Cloth in the Street’ – A protest song, originally written in Malthcumband, calling for weavers to rise up against an unjust leader. Banned in many evil-aligned areas, the song calls for the people to rise up and take back the city. Ironically, one of the governments to ban the song is the tyrannical Communal Autocracy of Malthcumband, formed by many of the same weavers the song was first written for."

      - "‘The Horrible Haggis of Hampstead Heath’ – A rhyming cumulative song about a mimic that swallows an farmer’s old, rotten haggis, gains magical powers, and then goes on a rampage. It devours an entire town, where every occupant, their occupation, their children, and the name of their family pets are listed. At first no-one stops it because they are too self-centered. In the end, the town’s guards and even the mayor are devoured. The song has a happy ending as the unlikely hero lets themselves get devoured and then slices open the mimic from the inside, releasing everybody safe and sound. The best bards are able to keep the crowd going for an entire hour, and then recite in reverse order the entire population of the village."
      - "‘Ogre-Melon Crawl’ – A catchy ditty which is a comedic precautionary tale about walking and not riding a horse if you have been drinking Ogre-Melon wine."
      - "‘Two Hundred and Seventeen Heartbeats’ – a controversial Elven composition. The singer takes a breath, then measures their pulse in silence for the duration that the title implies, while the audience is meant to slowly embrace the many natural sounds taking place during that time as a song of their own. It has been hailed by some musicians as a deep, thoughtful reflection on natural sounds, but criticized by others as a bad joke."

      - "‘Gandavous Thunke’ – Oh, Gandavous Thunke was a dangerous drunk with chaos instilled in his soul, And when faced with sellswords, or rampaging Orc Hordes, Or an angry cantankerous Troll, Old Gandy would growl and fix them with a scowl and unleash the magic inside, Calling forth lightning, or- equally frightening- A fireball, leaving them fried. Now, though it seems tragic, the use of the magic has had an effect on his hue; So if you’re foolhardy and meet him at a party, you can call him Old Gandy the Blue."
      - "‘This Moment of Magic’ – A love song about a wizard’s apprentice falling for his classmate as they cooperate in the creation of a summoning circle. ‘Though I open a gate to the Plane of Air, and float through unending skies, I would never find night that was dark as your hair, nor a view as blue as your eyes.’"

      - "‘My Hedgehog Son’ – A catchy, nonsense, drinking song about a magical, talking hedgehog that gets adopted by a childless farmer, the hedgehog rides a rooster like a knight on a horse, and makes the farmer rich. The song is filled with tongue twisters. Bards occasionally challenge each other to invent and repeat new verses, each more difficult and hilarious than the last, while taking a drink after every flubbed line."
      - "‘The Silken Meadow’ – Who knew ancient Eladrin epic poetry turned thousand year old ballad could be so raunchy?"
      - "‘Llolth’s Lullaby’ – An adventuring bard somewhere made it all the way down to the underdark, and heard one or two of the teaching songs sung by the Creche Matrons who give young Drow infants the education they need to survive the rigors of life; the song is in a deep dialect of undercommon that is almost never spoken anymore, but it is filled with all sorts of ‘Learning Magic’, mnemonics, and cultural references that makes it a sort of memetic hazard (you NEVER forget the words if sung by a powerful enough teacher), but the effect is less so when you don’t understand the language. That adventurous bard made it back to the surface, but not understanding the dialect of the deep, transposed the lullaby into a few other chords and added an improvisational lick of their own. That was a thousand years ago, and people have been humming and playing the tune up here ever since then, 50 generations later."

The red leather is artfully burned with the pattern of twining vines: when the soldier doffs his armor, he whispers a command in elvish, which awakens the vines and relaxes them, allowing the greaves to slip off easily and quickly.

Worn at the hip, the soft leather magazine’s curling, flared opening allows the archer to draw ammunition quickly and freely. Also, the ‘pollen’ within the quiver enchants the archer’s arrows with a naturally-derived soporific: any creature hit by an arrow drawn from this quiver must make a Constitution save to shake off an enchanted sleep."

      - "A soft-spoken Half-orc librarian and his wife, an Elvish herbalist. She isn’t as welcoming as him, but is alright with guests as long as they stay out of the workshop. They both do some of the cooking, so the meals are…unique."
      - "A Kobold matriarch. While her children have all moved out, their children are dropped off at Grandma’s house quite frequently, and she teaches them all she knows. She also runs a small shrine to Bahamut in the cellar."
      - "A hot-headed, wealthy heiress and her more rational lady-in-waiting."
      - "The prince of a corroding noble line, of late taken to dressing in black, composing gloomy poems, and brooding on the battlements of his manor."
      - "A dwarvish professor with a magnificent walrus mustache, as well as his warm, old-fashioned wife (a dressmaker) and their daughter, who’s visiting for a month or so from her apprenticeship."
      - "The quiet Mother of a hostel run by the temple of the god of the poor. The tragedy and despair of many of her visitors has rubbed off on her a little. The food is outstanding."
      - "A not-quite-right young man with ambitions to become a psychologist. Asks far too many personal questions, then goes off on rants about what he thinks shaped his guests to the people they are today. Total quack psychologist, doesn’t know what he’s saying at all."
      - "An Eladrin who’s spending a few centuries ‘indulging in kindness’. There’s a too-good-to-be-true air to the stay. Breakfast in bed, indoor training arena, a small dungeon built underneath the manor and stocked with inexpensive monsters, a wizard’s study, everything they could possibly want. And the host is always smiling."
      - "A jovial Goliath with an Australian accent who spends most of his time wrestling with various dangerous forms of wildlife. Owns a large merchant company, spends most of his time doing push-ups or lifting weights or wrestling yetis."
      - "A shriveled, wrinkled, hobbling old Bullywug whose sentences are out of order, and seems to speak in riddles. He wears a slightly threadbare robe and carries a walking stick."
      - "A stern Halfing dance instructor. She’s quite sprightly, humming waltz tunes as she works. She corrects people’s postures out of force of habit."
      - "An old Dragonborn mercenary who frequently lapses into a thousand-yard-stare. While not tormented by nightmares, he’s a good-humored guy with quite a few tips on adventuring."
      - "A water genasi weaver whose skill isn’t quite unmatched, but it’s up there. Naturally, the curtains and carpets of his house are expertly made and quite flamboyant."
      - "A cackling, bitter old woman. Actually a Green Hag, and her curse is the reason the couple next door (whom she finds insufferable) have been trying for a child for years without success. Serves stew or porridge for every meal from a huge, battered-looking black cauldron."
      - "A hard-as-nails half-elf rancher. Owns stables upon stables of pure-bred racing horses. Despises city-slickers."
      - "An old Minotaur noble. He wears huge suits, custom-made for him, and has a staff of Animated Objects who sing, dance, and make dinner."
      - "A slightly suspicious young woman. Knows far too much about weapons, disappears for long periods of time, and locks the basement door very heavily. She’s an assassin for a local gang of racketeers, and will skip town if she’s found out."
      - "An Animated Armor that speaks like the Discworld golems (That Is, She Talks Like This) and moves very jerkily. She (well, it’s built for a female humanoid) used to work for an evil artificer before a band of adventurers gave her full free will. Knows a thing or sixty-four about dungeoneering, and considers herself indebted to all adventurers."
      - "A goblin horse-jockey who loves nothing more than the thrill of a race. Talks a mile a minute, usually boasting about his races, and his house is full of trophies that he polishes devoutly."
      - "A human card-sharp who won his entire house in a game of Triple Ogres. He’s married to the shrewd but not very welcoming owner of a local tavern. She brings home the latest gossip each night."
      - "A kobold artificer who’s trying to turn his species’ natural affinity for mechanisms to the good. Owns all sorts of fascinating contraptions, like an automatic pencil-sharpener or a tiny construct that writes down any good ideas he has mid-conversation."
      - "A merry old smuggler, although he’s put his pirating days behind him aside from the odd chorus of Dead Man’s Chest. His house is adorned with model ships and sketches of exotic shores. Drinks strong home-brewed grog."
      - "The town doctor. There’s something odd about her of late. She stays up past midnight, tends to skip meals, and always seems to be tearing up some piece of paper and tossing it in the trash. (She’s smitten with the blacksmith’s apprentice, but can’t bring herself to tell him.)"
      - "A rough-and-ready frontier-dwelling female Dwarf, who lives in a quaint cottage. She’s older than most of the village, and knows all the skills of the hinterlands: medicine, hunting, cooking, the lot."
      - "An old man who can’t seem to look you in the eye. He has one craft, and one craft only: he’s a knife maker. Assassins from every syndicate, court or gang come to him for their daggers. Even the odd Drow comes in the dead of the night to buy an honest-to-Lolth Master Work dagger."
      - "A scheming duke who tries to see if the party thinks his power-plays would work without hinting too obviously at his massive ambitions."
      - "A satyr couple who are, well, typical satyrs. They love wine, music, food, the usual revel stuff. Enjoy having guests, of course, but can’t stand ‘sticks in the mud’, ‘killjoys’ or ‘introverts’."
      - "A female Drow who left the Underdark because she’s claustrophobic. Polite, in a regal sort of way. Her house doesn’t have hallways so much as long, broad halls, with bookcases or coffee tables or armchairs."
      - "A newer vampire who is having a little bit of an identity crisis. He gets the ‘nocturnal’ part, yes, he gets that, but isn’t the whole ‘domination’ thing a little unethical? and similar conversation. Keeps forgetting that garlic tastes disgusting to him now."
      - "The best Dwarvish pastry-chef that has ever walked the earth. And she knows it. Quite boastful."
      - "The keeper of a local shrine to the fire god. He’ll just sit by the fireplace, staring into it for hours on end. Has a very large and overly friendly golden retriever."
      - "The local ‘crazy cat lady’. An Air Genasi whose hair is always blowing in a gentle breeze. This confuses her cats to no end. She has forty-three of them, and one Mimic who enjoys it’s current lifestyle and has decided to stay shaped like a cat."
      - "A Tabaxi game-warden. His wolfhound isn’t part wolf, it’s part Displacer Beast, which means people often think he has two dogs. Pleasant but fairly quiet."
      - "A grizzled old human war veteran. Wears an eyepatch. Has a suit of plate-armor stained with horrific, otherworldly humors in his front hall. Retired after ridding his ancestral estate of some kind of great beast he refuses to describe."
      - "A gnomish scientist who studies modrons. He’s utterly fascinated by them, and can go on for hours with horrifically dull facts and factoids about them. His house is littered with mounted modrons, dissected modrons, everything modron-related you could imagine."
      - "A time-wizard who messes with his personal time for kicks. Making himself twelve years old, being in four places at once. He thinks it’s a riot. His house is full of books of temporal magic, or at least it was, twelve minutes before you try to open one of them. Opening one book makes them all vanish to the past. It’s his security system."
      - "A noble Knight Lord who lives in a small castle and commands an order of chivalrous Knights. A former adventurer."
      - "A wise Grand Wizard who lives in a magic tower and commands a guild of powerful Wizards. A former adventurer."
      - "A clever Spymaster who lives in a heavily-secured manor and commands a guild of Spies. A former adventurer."
      - "A pious High Priest of Light who lives in a modest house attached to a glorious Temple. A former adventurer."
      - "A homely man with balding white hair, a small beard and eyeglasses. Meets with friends often, talking for hours in the cellar. Are they…acting? Playing some sort of dice-game? It’s not quite clear. Says he hails from the realm of Greyhawk."
      - "An elvish professor of languages who, despite having fought in several wars, is a honorable, straight-laced, old-fashioned gentleman. He’s writing a rather long book. Apparently it’s about halflings and some kind of Ring?"
      - "A razor-witted Dwarvish comedian who does standup at local taverns, dishing out the side-clutchers and knee-slappers galore. Willing to share a few jokes with the party, too. His ‘why did the cockatrice cross the road?’ always gets ’em."
      - "A Bugbear leg-breaker for the local mob is trying way too hard to be polite and gracious. His apartment’s nice, of course, but he seems to think that the entire party are some sort of sting operation."
      - "A former Underdark delver, this calm but dispassionate female Tiefling is married to a far more bubbly and cheery Wood Elf. They bicker regularly about what ‘acceptable decorations’ are, stuffed Troglodyte heads or singing roses."
      - "A brawny whiskey-maker who meets over a nice, old keg with rogues and grave-robbers every night, it seems. His house is above his tavern."
      - "An Eladrin woodcarver who has recently taken up trying to enchant things. She’s terribly confident it’ll work out eventually, but for now you’ll have to put up with wooden busts that hurl abuse or curse words and cutlery that work together to spell out rather rude slang."
      - "A Halfling balloonist with a terrible case of wanderlust. Half of his things haven’t been unpacked yet, half of them are already ready to go."
      - "A master wizard who crafts Golems. Has some shady deals with dungeon overlords, but is still a good man. Might cut the Evil Overlords off from his business if approached; he’s a man of principles, just needs a push of sorts to get him to stand his ground for them."
      - "An Aasimar teamster who’s moving into the song business. He’s got quite the voice, and a few songs already written: All Shook Up, 500 Miles, and he’s working on a few more."
      - "A slightly edgy Tiefling who wants to be both friendly and intimidating. Budding metalhead. His apartment is nearly plastered with band posters and song lyrics."
      - "A genteel, aristocratic Red Dragon who lives in an enormous castle."
      - "A curious young man enamored by the sea. Despite his youth, his hair is receding. He never seems to blink, either. His house is full of weird idols and jewelry of ancient civilizations."
      - "A charlatan ‘wizard’ who’s really just a chemist. Tries to keep her lab hidden. Nearly has a breakdown if she’s confronted about her fraud."
      - "A Goliath strongman of the local circus. His quarters are rather large, because he’s rather large. They’re right next to the acrobats’ and the lion tamer’s."
      - "A vain elvish wizard who spends most of her time in front of her magic mirror, and the rest of it complaining about upload schedules and dislike mobs and ad revenue."
      - "A dwarvish butcher. His wife is an author. Both of his daughters are in preschool. He himself is vegetarian, but does eat fish. Spends his evenings playing pool in the cellar with his friends, or going on walks with his daughters."
      - "A professional court-jester of the local duke or lord. Not as cheery off the job; gripes to anyone who’ll listen about his poor wages and difficult job. His house is a small cottage within the bailey of the castle."
      - "A tight-lipped priest who seems to have a shrine to every god in his tiny house. The hallways are crammed with altars and icons, and the whole place smells like incense 24/7."
      - "An unintentionally insufferable Aasimar ballerina. Lets the guests have the run of the kitchen; she’s too busy practicing for her next performance in the studio downstairs."
      - "A young bachelor Mountain Dwarf, who’s bitter about getting turned down by the local army or militia. He’s drinking a little more than is good for him."
      - "A gnomish jeweler, his wife and three children. They have a pretty large townhouse. The husband is a little busy with an important order: a new crown for an anonymous nobleman."
      - "A halfling priest of various gods of knowledge and nature. He’s a part-time biologist, running a few experiments in the lab in his basement. He’d love to meet a Druid or Ranger with more hands-on experience than himself."
      - "A Fey who lives in a checkers-themed tower. May kick the guests out if they mention chess or use chess analogies. Most of the food is circular (pie, pancakes, etc.), the tablecloths and bedsheets all have checkered patterns. Writes long letters to a bitter rival."
      - "A Fey who lives in a chess-themed tower. Gets rather testy if people mention checkers. The staff are construct automatons that only move like particular chess pieces. Complains about a completely irrational rival who sends him storms of nonsense letters every day."
      - "A professional human trick-shot-archer. She goes on tour with the circus now and then. Her favorite one is nailing a playing card out of someone’s hand from one hundred paces."
      - "A stout Dwarf who’s a master cook. He puts his heart and soul into every slab of beef, taking hours just to prepare them for barbecuing. Doesn’t spend much time with the guests."
      - "A human former doctor (she’s still got the beak-mask hung up on the wall in an airtight case, and she warns the party that it’s quite contaminated) who retired after fighting some sort of otherworldly entity beneath her ancestral estate. Recently took up horse-riding."
      - "A human comedian whose jokes tend to be at his own expense. Unmarried but pretty well-off, for a comedian. He tends to leave in the evening and come back close to midnight after his show."
      - "An eladrin priest of Tymora. Closer to his fey ancestry than most Eladrin. He’s scheming with a local gang to spring some of their hooligans from prison- after all, the whims of chance are unpredictable, or so he’ll say if the party threatens to inform the authorities. Then he will try and bribe them."
      - "A calm Oriental-looking man who works as a janitor during the day. His apartment isn’t exactly barren, but it’s certainly unextravagant. He’s teaching a local child the various martial arts he mastered in his time as a Monk."
      - "A simple Halfling herb-farmer. She has a small plot of land behind her house, where she grows things like spices and vegetables. Patient, because as she says, you can’t hurry peppers. Spends most of her time reading novels."
      - "A dragonborn tale-weaver. No, not an author, she’s quite firm. A tale-weaver, the kind that don’t get written down so much as passed along. Though she doesn’t exactly have it in writing, she’s very familiar with the wording and themes that make a riveting tale."
      - "A solemn, gods-fearing Dwarvish carpenter. They call him the Pious Benchmaker, which baffles him. His wife is of somewhat better cheer, but tolerates no nonsense in her house. The furniture is first-rate. You could hit it with a battle-hammer and it wouldn’t dent."
      - "An Aasimar mattress-maker. Laments his own misfortune: his mattresses are so good, he either sleeps on them and can’t get himself out of bed, or he sleeps on a couch or armchair and doesn’t sleep well. It’s a DC X Strength save to get off his guest-beds (the best ones, for he’s quite hospitable), where X is 10 plus the number of days since the sleeper has been in a normal bed instead of a bedroll or cot."
      - "A slightly unhinged half-orc scholar. He’s studying all sorts of bizarre phenomena at once, and keeps a wall covered in notes, sketches, and pieces of twine connecting them. The statistical anomalies of coin flips, the way the planet is tilted, all those sorts of things. Frequently becomes so engrossed in his studies he forgets to eat."
      - "A ratcatcher who is quite ferocious in his task. He’s got mousetraps all over the place, and hundreds of rat skulls nailed to his wall. Grim, adamant, and talks at length about what utter vermin rodents are."
      - "A friendly, jocular doppelganger illusionist and it’s tame mimic pets. The house appears to have a large staff of servants and much finely-made furniture…"
      - "A gnomish Expert Clown. He doesn’t just study mere tossing and tumbling, mind you. He studies the psychology of clowning. What makes a pie to the face so funny? Or what is the thrill-inducing factor of juggling eggs? He can tell you. He can tell you for several hours."
      - "A human stone-carver and his teenage son. The son’s a little worried about his father, as the latter seems to be losing interest in the craft. Their house is full of half-finished works."
      - "A high elf mask-maker. It’s a delicate craft, she’ll tell you. Fey come to call every so often, picking up their masks but also staying to chat with her a bit. So do some actors. And one or two assassins."
      - "A scruffy human gravedigger. He isn’t exactly a philosopher, but tends to make incisive remarks about mortality and time. Doesn’t like elves, because they don’t give him business."
      - "An old man with a bald head and gleaming eyes. If asked, he only gives his profession as ‘chemist’, and spends a lot of time in his lab. He’s less harmless than he seems; he’s the master poison-brewer for a local assassin’s guild. If he’s found out, he calls in his allies on whoever discovered his true identity."
      - "A young couple of a Tiefling and an Aasimar. Their ancestors didn’t like the marriage much, and it couldn’t exactly get officiated by a priest (but the local marriage law did allow for a Fey to do the job). They’re getting along fine."
      - "A pious couple who are gravely concerned about their young daughter. She claims to see ‘shadowy people’ in the cellar, and apparently brought the family dog back to life. They’re both nearly nervous wrecks, and priests of every Good god have been coming and going all week to try and exorcise the child."
      - "A white-haired old man and his shrill wife, both the village healers, although the Mr. recently got fired by the prince whose father he used to work for."
      - "A playwright who is outraged at his rivals trying to spread the rumor that his work was ghostwritten for him. Insists on reading off sonnets and scenes to the guests to prove that he’s genuine."
      - "A grizzled, scarred town guard. He’s only in during the day, usually asleep, and spends the nights walking the streets and smoking very particular cheap cigars. Moody but not hostile."
      - "A ‘professional quest-giver’ who pampers the heroes with everything he can. He’s in kahoots with a local dungeon-lord, and gets a share of the armor, weapons and loot of the heroes killed in the dungeon he directs them towards. He’ll take to the hills if he’s found out."
      - "A young priestess of a god of the wilds. Her house is on the very outskirts of town, and has a terrible case of rats, which she doesn’t mind as long as they don’t bother the guests. Rats that do bother the guests get speared. She doesn’t take nonsense, but has some sense of humor."
      - "A Kenku minstrel who rents a room above the tavern he performs in. It’s covered in posters from his ‘glory-days’- although a keen eye (DC 15 Investigation) will note that they’re actually other bards’ posters, with the minstrel’s name altered into them."
      - "An apprentice baker and his wife, a schoolteacher. Their house was a cheap deal, and is a little run-down but still serviceable. Gets a little drafty, though."
      - "A Kobold who claims to be an architect and interior designer. Actually, she’s a dungeon planner who designs catacombs, lairs and castles galore. Highly sought-after by evil overlords, and frantically tries to direct them away while the guests are there. If she’s found out, she’ll flee to the safety of one of her closer creations."
      - "A Swordsmith who has been at it for years. He keeps a display case of splintered, shattered or blunted swords recovered from various dungeons and battlefields, each with the tale of a fallen hero attached to it."
      - "A halfling gourmand with an affinity for candies. He’s a longstanding foe of witches who use his creations, or mockeries thereof, to lure children into their cook-pots."
      - "A Dwarvish family of four- father, mother, son, daughter -who are rather new in town. Hospitable, but the house is still full of moving crates. The father is a lumberjack, the mother is a stay-at-home parent."
      - "The High Priest of a local shrine of the god of travelers and messengers. He’s an unmatched source of information, references and road maps, and will greet anybody with a smile so long as they return the favor."
      - "An old Elvish couple. The husband spends most of his time golfing or whittling, the wife is busy giving advice to her newly-married daughter. They live in a nice old house, although there’s a ghost in the attic. Don’t worry, it’s very polite during the day, and it can’t leave the attic."

    entries:
      - "…how to arrange flowers in a vase in such a way that they do not appear to be arranged at all, but haphazardly splayed about as if just dropped there. It takes a long time to learn how to arrange flowers so precisely to look completely unarranged. The first 10 years you don’t even touch the flowers, you just contemplate the nature of unarranged flowers."
      - "…the perfect comeback to a childhood rival who once taunted you by saying something mean. You said something back but upon retrospection it wasn’t very clever. Haunted by this failure you have spent the next 25 years painstakingly researching his genealogy, habits, and circle of friends, carefully refining and reshaping the ultimate bon mot should he ever insult you again. (You can’t insult him first, as you already “returned fire” as it were. Gibing etiquette requires him to insult you again before you can respond. Of course you haven’t seen him in 2d10 years, but if you do, you’re ready!)"
      - "…to speak a long-dead and all-but-forgotten language perfectly without a trace of an accent. Were there any speakers of this language still around, they would likely (DC 10) be utterly convinced you are a native speaker of it. But there aren’t any."
      - "…how to recognize merely by seeing the color through the bottle the exact variety, vintage, and vinification method of Elf wines grown in a specific region. Of course this relies on the wine being properly stored at the correct temperature, humidity, and darkness; if something’s just a little off it will alter the color, making it impossible to know anything without actually opening the bottle to smell or even (gasp) taste it, which would be cheating."
      - "…the precise movements of a complicated stretching/meditative exercise similar to Tai Chi but not at all like Tai Chi. Rather than trancing in a sitting position like some bourgey Wood Elf, you can trance while standing up and making gentle hand movements."
      - "…the delicate art of scrimshawing Elven poetry onto the surface of living leaves. It’s quite a challenge because you want the runes to be legible but you don’t want to kill the leaf. It takes many weeks of painstakingly meticulous work. If you start in early Spring and work very diligently, hours a day for weeks on end, you can finish an average length poem just before the first frost of Autumn kills the leaf. (Note your character can’t scrimshaw onto other wood, bone, or other materials. Of course they can’t. Why would they even want to? How gauche!)"
      - "…the byzantine rules of a complicated role-playing game you loved as a child but haven’t actually played in years."
      - "…the flavor combinations of a High Elven grain-based cuisine that is completely unknown to anyone outside of your particular Elven clan. It is so subtle that every dish tastes exactly the same to someone without at least a decade of gustatory training and discipline."
      - "…the subtle art of relieving yourself of bodily necessities in the most inconvenient places without being noticed."
      - "…how to meticulously manipulate your hair, strand by strand, so that it grows into a braid. You simply need to touch your hair once every hour or so for a few months to create or modify a braid."
      - "…mastering building card castles. The first year or so you spent your time finding the balance of each of the very specific eleven cards, so that you can find the different force members and build a structurally sound card castle. You made very interesting and elaborate castles, but since you left, you haven’t found a deck of cards with the exact same balance, and any attempts to build one with a normal deck of cards results in the castles collapse."
      - "…how to twist silver wire into intricate knots that approximate the pleasing curves of Elven calligraphy. If you had a very large spool of wire and about a year, you could make a beautiful wall hanging of your favorite poem."
      - "…how to speak naturally while you are breathing in. You never need to stop talking!"
      - "…all about Dwarven and Gnomish machinery, which you were of course forbidden to ever touch or observe in person due to its religiously unclean nature. In secret, you read every book you could get your hands on about the theory of engineering, without ever trying it yourself. Most of what you learned is hundreds or thousands of years out of date."
      - "…the anatomy of a rare type of fruit fly. +5 to Medicine checks concerning this type of fruit fly."
      - "(Dark Elf or Evil only, re-roll if you are not) …the construction of Dark Elvish poetry, which involves tormenting slaves or captives in extremely specific ways that cause their screams and pleas for mercy to fit strict rules of meter and verse. Any deviations from the rubric, and the poem has to start again from the beginning. They are typically thousands of lines long."
      - "…how to mix pigments into a color beyond the capability of Elven eyes to distinguish. Elven Druids have determined, after careful consultation with butterflies and mantis shrimp, that there are many colors beyond those Elves can see. After years of training, you can grind a memorized recipe of flowers, seeds, and a rare kind of seasnail shell into a pigment that is rather pleasing (it is said) to those creatures with 10 or more photoreceptors. To everyone else it just looks like a particularly ugly shade of greenish brown. Note you don’t know where to gather the required materials, or how to paint with them, just how to create the pigment."
      - "…mastery of your mind’s eye. You can visualize as many objects moving in any way in as much detail as you want. However, the more elements are present, the slower you must make it revolve. Overall this provides no advantage when visualizing a situation."
      - "…the evaluation and criticism of blown glass sculptures of a kind produced by the Uuajarithin Dynasty, which ruled the northwestern region of a local island for several decades around twelve thousand years ago. You can immediately appreciate the differences and similarities between the three main schools of Uujarithin glass and the aesthetic differences which caused their schism. This might be useful if only there were more than a half-dozen examples remaining on the planet."
      - "…the art of eyebrow manipulation. You can manipulate your eyebrows in such a way as to create a perfectly animated wave. Any attempt to use this to improve your acting leads you to start wiggling your eyebrows uncontrollably."
      - "…the deep formulations involved in calculating the precise distances between runes and glyphs used in the creation of magic summoning circles and wards; this is a skill that all magic-users can perform instinctively and without any conscious thought. You, however, know why they are spacing them just so."
      - "…blinking patterns. You have learnt to predict when some else will blink, allowing you to blink at the same time, making them believe you do not blink. If you try to use this to improve an intimidation attempt they think you are blind."
      - "…the life of Carl. You followed the life of a Human child from birth. Carl had a relatively mundane childhood but actually left to be an adventurer in his early 20s! Those few months were greatly interesting until he was eaten by something with a lot of tentacles in a swamp. Thankfully the creature was incredibly resilient and slow so you had ample time to take notes on Carl’s death and even make a few sketches of him disappearing into the muck."
      - "…Human pop culture. Knowing that some day you might travel the world in the company of Humans, you spent a lot of time studying Human jesters, bards, and performers, memorizing the most popular acts. Alas, Human pop culture changes quite quickly by Elven standards and all of your references are decades out of date. Younger Humans have no idea what you’re talking about; older Humans will smile faintly as they vaguely recall something along those lines."
      - "…more than a thousand decorative knots, none of which are more useful then a thumb knot."
      - "…knot-tying with your tongue. You can tie all the knots you know using only your tongue."
      - "(High Elf only, re-roll if you are not) …the apologetics of a very, very long treatise on the many metaphysical reasons why High Elves are vastly superior to all other races of thinking being, on an intrinsic level. You can convincingly argue hundreds of rhetorical approaches from this book, which all other races find deeply offensive. Just bringing it up in public is a good way to start a fight with any non-High Elf."
      - "…the bird song of a particularly rare sub-sub-species of an otherwise very common bird. The song of the sub-sub-species is — to the untrained ear — indistinguishable from that of the common bird, and it annoys you to no end when people assume you’re imitating the song of the common bird, which almost any fool can do."
      - "(Non-Sorcerers Only) …how to be a sorcerer. You tried really, really hard to be a sorcerer. Like just focusing super hard and being like “magic, magic, magic”. It didn’t work."
      - "…the minute detail of a single small Human town as a sociological project. It was going really well but eventually Orcs sacked the place and put everyone to the sword. Ugh, Orcs, right?"
      - "…the alphabets of any language you speak, in order, starting from any letter. You’re able to do this both forwards and backwards."
      - "(Those without a musical instrument proficiency, re-roll if you have one) …that you aren’t very talented at playing particular instruments. First you tried to learn the lute. Gave up after six months when it got hard. Tried the bagpipes. Gave up after six months when it got bad. After many years, you now know there are dozens of instruments out there you can’t play."
      - "…the genealogies, birth places, and biographies of the women who were considered for marriage to the princes of a long-ago Elven dynasty, but ultimately were not chosen. You don’t know anything about what happened to them after they weren’t chosen, just everything about them up to the point where someone else was ultimately selected. (You also don’t know anything about the women who were selected.)"
      - "(Non-Rangers and Non-Druids only, if you are, re-roll) …how to tell different species of (1d6: 1-3) wolves or (4-6) bears apart from the taste of their fur. You can accurately (DC 10) tell the creature’s age, sex, species, and current mood (usually angry at being licked). Now you only need to be able to get the animal to let you lick it and voilá it’s your time to shine!"
      - "…how to live with a Human. As an elaborate prank, you seduced a Human and built a life together. Two decades later you finally revealed yourself only to discover the other person also was an Elf the whole time; by coincidence they also had the same idea for an elaborate prank. (It turns out if you really had been living with a Human they would have figured it out immediately as it turns out Humans do weird stuff like sleep.) Had a laugh about it together and parted ways."
      - "…how to mimic the singing of a green frogmouth parrot, a bird that went extinct by men in your early years due to its horrendous sound. You can now wow archaeologists and get kicked in/from a tavern for the same reason."
      - "…illusion magic. One horrible tragedy later, sought out a mage to erase that knowledge. This was repeated with necromancy, tinkering, and cooking. You successfully unlearned all you had learned."
      - "…the location of everything in your childhood home. Blindfolded, from your front stoop you could walk into your home and prepare a nine-course dinner. This is assuming of course nothing has been moved in the time since you’ve been away."
      - "…nothing about the Sword Coast. You spent years on a walkabout up and down the Sword Coast, just to get some space and chill. By traveling only at night, hiding from all you encountered, and never spending more than the barest amount of time in any one particular place, you were able to do this without learning anything notable about the Sword Coast."
      - "…hair braiding. You’re really good at making intricate hair braids. Or you used to be, it’s been awhile since you practiced. To your annoyance, non-Elves usually don’t sit still for the four hours required to do a proper braid and other races apparently don’t like it if you try to braid their hair while they sleep."
      - "…thinking of creative insults for other races. Most of the insults are so sublime the other races don’t even realize they’re being insulted, which makes it all the funnier to you."
      - "…the art of swordmaking. You are quite good at drawing pictures of people making swords."
      - "…water course training. By finding a natural spring (or for you more modern types a mechanical one) you slowly shape a stream bed by making minuscule alterations that will, one day, result in a unique formation. Carefully placing small stones, planting trees, or removing roots, you learn to twist a stream over the course of decades into something different. Some humans have done this with trees, but they’re just amateurs."
      - "…chicken sculpting. Through intense study of the diet and breeding habits of chickens, you are able to feed one dish to a rooster and the other to a hen, such that the hen will lay an egg of an unusual shape or with a particular pattern or image on it. This only works with a given individual rooster and hen; to do it with different chickens, you need to learn it all over again."
      - "…the ideal responses, mannerisms, and cadence for the best polite small talk. Not how to make any small talk polite, that was a different class. You learned how to engage in the most mathematically polite conversation possible, which happens to be about how unseasonably mild the weather was the day before yesterday in the early afternoon."
      - "… the ability to tell by sound the material and age of any bow string made using the common techniques of your home clan. Of course, this can only be done under certain humidity conditions at an elevation identical to that of your home village. Any other elevation or humidity conditions result in a completely different sound spectrum, which you would have to spend years relearning. Attempting to recognize the sounds not under the same conditions will result in you being completely mistaken."
      - "…how to create pressed leaf collages in the style of trees in autumn. You’ve spent years observing the fall of leaves on the ground, the seemingly unordered but sublime beauty of each leaf landing and overlapping the next, the play of color and texture, the harmonious use of scale and repetition. Through careful study and practice, you can perfectly duplicate the style of various specific trees’ leaf collages, laying out pressed leaves in your home or garden in a pattern of intense poetry. Now when you see the last leaf of the season fall from a tree and its completed collage, you can appreciate its beauty so deeply you’re nearly moved to tears."
      - "…how to blink your lower and upper eyelids independently."
      - "…extremely accurate cylinder throwing. You can, at a glance, tell whether a given cylindrical object can fit into a hole or crevice hundreds of feet away. Further, you can throw said object so that it will perfectly land in said hole. The countless metal cylinders you originally commissioned for this purpose were geometrically perfect, however. The usual pens, pipes, and branches you can find are usually warped enough that your skill is instead to always almost throw a cylinder into a hole."
      - "…the names, records, and anecdotes about the most accurate cylinder throwers in Elven history, as above."
      - "…the ability to accurately identify when a given patch of paint will be dry. This was learned by studiously watching paint dry and your thorough experience now makes you an expert in the field of paint drying."
      - "…how to create beautiful, but delicately crafted ice sculpture of a flock of birds in flight. The slightest movement or change in temperature will result in the sculpture collapsing, so you cannot even risk returning to it for fear of your body temperature upsetting the delicate balance necessary to maintain the sculpture’s form."
      - "…the ability to blow smoke rings in elegant configurations. If your character doesn’t smoke, don’t re-roll — your studies were all theoretical on the off-chance you took up smoking one day. If you do, you will be able to blow some nice smoke rings… probably."
      - "…accurately determine the distance of objects. You spent many years placing objects at random distances in order to better judge how far away they are. Now you are able to tell how far away something is from you, as long as it’s within 1 mile."
      - "…accurately measure objects at hand. You have extensively measured all your body parts to determine their exact width and length, so you know if something is a thumb wide it’s 7/8ths of an inch, or if it’s the span between your nostrils it’s an 2/9ths of an inch, and what-have-you. You can measure any object you can touch as long as it is your size or smaller. Measuring some objects requires that you remove some clothing. Due to the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle you must re-measure yourself each morning to ensure you are still properly calibrated."
      - "…the ability to discern from a glance what a tea made with a particular leaf would taste like. Your particular specialty are leaves that would make particularly foul-tasting teas, which among Elves is a highly prized skill. You don’t understand why your non-Elven companions don’t appreciate you pointing out all the leaves they shouldn’t brew into tea."
      - "…how to teach synchronized swimming to the last two surviving members of a rare subspecies of seahorse, both of whom were female. The night before they were set to perform in a much-anticipated recital, one of them died, rendering decades of work completely irrelevant. The second one was eaten by a cat the next day. No other seahorses in the world have the same behavior patterns as the now-extinct breed that you tragically lost."
      - "…cheesemaking, specifically, a very rare type of cheese (or mushroom if your Elves are vegan) that takes many years to ripen to perfection. It smells awful and looks hideous, a sickly pale color shot through with weird spidery veins. But the taste! The taste is… rather appalling, no matter how sophisticated the palate. But cultured Elves know the time and effort it takes to develop it properly and out of politeness always manage to choke it down."
      - "…a self-defense technique for use against unarmored attackers wielding left-handed halberds. If such a foe targets you with an attack and misses, you get a bonus action. This bonus action may only be used to point out how inept their attack is compared to the unarmored left-handed halberd wielders of yore."
      - "…the ability to know what kind of snow is going to fall as it falls. You cannot predict snow fall, totals, or anything else related to weather, only if the snow currently falling is fluffy snow, dry snow, wet snow, good snowman snow, etc. You also know each of the 53 words the Elves of the Northern Reaches use for snow, and always are sure to use the absolute most precise one for the type of snow that is falling or about to fall, and helpfully point out to your companions when they use an incorrect term."
      - "…the ability to tell the type of wood an object is made from using only one of your five senses. If you roll this one again. choose an additional sense."
      - "…the ability to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes (through Astral projection), but only if you’ve met them, if you are meditating, and if they’re not wearing them while you meditate. While doing this, you can’t perceive anything while in the other person’s shoes, save the comfort level of said shoes."
      - "…every detail of an obscure point of Elven theology involving when and how one pours tea into a sacred tea pot. You are so versed in this topic and the technical jargon surrounding it that it sounds almost like a different language should you try to converse with someone not familiar with the subject. There are only two or three Elves in the whole world who might be able to argue with you about this."
      - "…a perfect understanding of how long soaps and perfumes will maintain their scent and exactly when to reapply them."
      - "…how to determine, after eating any cheese, what type of fungus also lives in the cave where that cheese matured."
      - "…how to write one letter of the Elvish alphabet. You spent years practicing how to write this one letter. All other letters are average for an elf of your age, but you can perfectly draw an incredibly stylish letter of your choice. If you roll this result again, pick another letter."
      - "…how to, after much research, craft toys from a long-dead civilization. The toys are all invariably quite dangerous in the hands of children and likely led to the civilization’s demise from low childhood survival rates."
      - "…the ability to decorate the most beautiful cupcake arrangements. Your particular specialty are cupcake arrangements for funerals. Unsurprisingly, your talent is turned down by almost all the grief-stricken people that you offer it to. Note you can’t bake the cupcakes, only decorate them. Baking was another class."
      - "…how to freestyle rap but only in an extremely ancient and obscure dialect of a dead language that virtually no one speaks. Including you. You aren’t quite sure what you’re saying. But it is dazzling to hear."
      - "(Non-Clerics only; if a Cleric, re-roll) …the marriage ceremonies of many cultures around the world, and can perform them perfectly. (Whether you are licensed to perform them, however, is a different matter.) Whenever you attend a wedding, you always know when the officiant, groom, bride, or guest has committed a faux pas."
      - "…you have become an expert on the finer points of facial hair, including its growth, grooming and styles. The fact that as an Elf you cannot in fact grow facial hair has not deterred you, and you have taken every opportunity to study it “in the wild”, occasionally while the wearer is asleep."
      - "…how to write a sprawling epic in which you created your own world, languages, pantheon of gods, mythologies, races, and histories; the glossary alone totals more than 100,000 words. Of course you would never publish it, or even allow anyone else to read it, as it’s not finished yet. What’s the rush? You’ll get back to it in a century or two."
      - "(Non-Rangers only; if a Ranger, re-roll) …how to take very long strides. You’ve practiced taking dramatic, long steps, and you can move your feet further than most without ever having both leave the ground. Unfortunately, it isn’t really as dramatic as you’d have liked and actually looks pretty ridiculous."
      - "…how to juggle up to eight objects very well, but they all have to be citrus fruits or else they just feel wrong in your hands."
      - "…you spent years learning to create four-dimensional art. Unfortunately, because no one can actually perceive the fourth dimension, the results are invariably hideous (except possibly to Beholders)."
      - "…how to relax. As a kid your parents were really uptight, and you spent a lot of time studying. In your 50s you went through a teenage rebellion stage where you refused to do anything and spent a couple decades just hanging out and smoking goodherb. Your parents were worried you would turn out to be a bum like your cousin, who is nearly 200 years old and still lives in your aunt’s basement. But eventually you got it together."
      - "…the art of shaping a rare kind of Narcissus flowers local to your home town. The flowers must be grown in a very specific pot, with water from a precise point in a creek, and of course the bulb itself must have exactly seven perfectly balanced lobes, otherwise it’ll just become a very ordinary looking plant. It has not helped that for the past 13 years, only five- and six-lobed bulbs have been found."
      - "…how to craft chess pieces in exquisite detail, from nearly any type of material. After 25 years you finally have three pieces finished to your satisfaction."
      - "…about snowflakes. You were determined to disprove the commonly-held belief that every single snowflake is different. You have yet to find a snowflake that exactly matched another one you’ve seen, but you are convinced that duplicates come into existence all the time, in fact you’re probably missing one right now as it melts on a blade of grass somewhere."
      - "…underwater basketweaving. The ironweed of the Marshal Swamps can be harvested and then processed into flexible yet strong strands that can be weaved, underwater, into baskets of the highest quality — with details and patterns fine as the finest embroidery, and strong enough to survive an Elf life’s worth of usage. Note you don’t know how to harvest the weed or how to process it, or even where the Marshal Swamps are, but you are quite good at weaving the processed strands."
      - "…how to grow extremely ornate living flower crowns."
      - "…a highly complex form of advanced theoretical mathematics. It is said there are only a handful of Elves in the world who truly understand it. Unfortunately you aren’t one of them. After 25 years of study you can barely grasp the most fundamental concepts, but so few people have studied this field of mathematics that it’s easy to fake mastery of it. You’re beginning to suspect the handful of people who claim to understand it are also faking it. It would be poor etiquette to expose them."
      - "…origami."
      - "…your local ecosystem. You studiously watched one termite nest or anthill for a year, taking notes on all they do, the way they interact with other animals and plants, and seeing how they fit into a larger ecosystem. Then, pick one of the slightly more complex creature types they interacted with, and watch them for a year. Do that again and again, until you can trace how every single living thing within a mile of your home interconnects in the unbroken weave of life, up to and including you."
      - "…how to cultivate an air of subtle superiority over the flora native to your home. Any plants that are endemic to your place of birth will find you to be stuck up and have difficulty persuading you to join their cause. This applies only to non-sentient plants."
      - "…all about your date of birth. You did extensive research on all the events that have occurred on your birth day throughout recorded history. Unfortunately it turns out to be an exceedingly boring day."
      - "…one hundred different ways to count. Base 10 is so unimaginative."
      - "…the ability to tell, just from the smell of the smoke, what type of wood is being burned. If you get this result again, you can also determine the age of the wood."
      - "…the ancient High Elven method of reading through the use of a Braille-like script. You can read books printed with this script using one hand. If you get this result again, you also have mastered the art of simultaneously reading a second book using the other hand. If you get this result a third time, you can use each hand and one foot. A fourth time and you can read four books. If you get this result a fifth time, you are banned from your hometown library."
      - "…your family tree, back seven generations. Given that these are Elves, that’s a very, very long time indeed, requiring a lot of research. You actually don’t know much about them besides their names and who they are related to. About a decade into it, you discovered a distant cousin also has created a family tree and there is a slight discrepancy concerning the issue of your great-great-grandfather. It’s caused quite the controversy in your family."
      - "…a Drow method of shadow puppetry traditionally practiced in light so dim few creatures can actually see it."
      - "…the ability to draw your sword with flamboyant panache. When using this technique, you are -2 to initiative, but every time you draw your sword (even if from a leather scabbard) there is a mildly satisfying schrrriiinnnggg! Note you can still draw your sword normally, but why would you?"
      - "…nature critique. The practice of pondering how nature could be more beautiful."
      - "…arrow fletching. Through the use of cunning feather placement, slightly bent arrow shafts, and tiny holes drilled in the arrowheads, you can create arrows that artfully soar in aesthetically pleasing spirals, curves, and loops. This provides no game benefit (for example, you can’t cause the arrow to hit someone behind cover) as the arrows in question are far too delicate to be used in combat. (Inspired by Goblin Punch)"
      - "…the ability to move unimpeded by high heels. As a fashion-forward Elf that didn’t want to give up the chance to show off your style 24/7, you relentlessly practiced moving around in high heels. You can fight, balance, and run with high heels just as easily as you could barefoot. Your balance while barefoot has not improved at all, however, and this only ever applies to high-heeled shoes."
      - "…the Human form of stretching/relaxation known as yoga. Not doing it, rather observing and studying it to determine if it has any long-term beneficial effects. You don’t think it does, but more research is required."
      - "…the art of drawing a perfect circle in any medium, as long as the circle is no bigger than your hand. (Note: It’s a really, really good circle, but sometimes you suspect it’s not quite perfect.)"
      - "…how to determine whether a perfect circle truly is perfect. You’ve seen some really, really good circles, but you’ve yet to find a perfect one."
      - "(Non-Drow only, if Drow re-roll) …research into cloud divination. Having tried different mediums, interpreting their predictions in the most broad way possible, over two and a half decades you have utterly disproved cloud watching as a divination method. Note that you have not actually learned cloud watching or any divination of your own, to stay impartial to the study. The cloud diviners predicted you would say this."
      - "(Non-Druids only, if Druid re-roll) …the art of encouraging growth in one particular species of non-sentient plant through the use of subtle sarcasm, veiled threats, and passive-aggressive attacks cloaked as constructive criticism. (If this plant ever acquire sentience, it will require therapy.) As a result of your efforts, the plant grows 2.4% faster per year than a plant without such attention. If you get this result again, you may either pick a second species, or get 4.8% faster growth in the same species."

    entries:
      - "A tall and husky Gold Dragonborn, clad in bright colored and decorative clothing, sits on an equally ornate rug. He’s fidgeting with something in his mouth. It’s has a small garnet, chipped by his teeth and covered in spit. He has a small pouch in his vest full of these gross little gems. He sells very beautiful jewelry, thankfully with no bite marks."
      - "Two very young Halfling brothers are making dumplings. The dumplings are way too big even for a normal sized person, but they taste pretty good."
      - "A tiefling who’s missing a tooth smiles quite charismatically. He’s selling potions and poisons, but they’re stored in old, reused liquor bottles. Kinda weird, but mostly harmless."
      - "This human-elf couple makes soap. They’re super happy because of their soap, which is always enchanted into putting anyone who uses it into a good mood."
      - "This scrawny kobold is making guns. He loves his firearms to death, despite being too small to wield a majority of them. He just loves his craft."
      - "A bald, female wizard doesn’t actually sell anything, but she enchants items for others. She also has a hairless cat, probably related to the same incident. She has looks that could kill, but she is super sensitive when someone brings up her lack of hair."
      - "A young, quiet librarian sits behind a desk reading a book. When the player gets closer, they notice that she’s actually a centaur. She’s quite dainty and gentle for her size."
      - "A disabled dwarf creates small trinkets from bed. His half human daughter takes care of him, but a network of clockwork beasts run his store front, taking care of sales and maintaining each other so they’ll sell for a pretty penny. Rumors about him creating a chair with wheels are spreading, so he’ll finally be mobile again."
      - "An unlikely pair of merchants run an apothecary, alternatingly with one working on baubles while the other deals with customers. The dwarf is a grumpy old man, nearly unapproachable, and usually berates his half-orc apprentice even when in front of the customers. When asked, he typically overprices and generally shuts down any attempts at haggling. The half-orc apprentice is suspicious and intimidating in appearance, and sound threatening when replying to his dwarf master, but is actually much more cordial to the customers and is more lenient when haggling. Both, however, like their beer."
      - "A gnome tinker who has all kinds of different scrounged and jury-rigged magic items. He appears on his cart every couple hours until the party buys something."
      - "An aarakocra resembling a vulture who sells things he finds. By ‘finds’, he means he takes stuff off of dead bodies and whatever else he sees lying around. He’ll sell random pieces of armor, weapons, books, and food he cooks himself with scavenged meats and the like. He’s a great cook and a cynical old coot. His coyote & pepper stew is quite popular."
      - "A thin man wearing a backpack seemingly too large to carry. Inside are various minor magic items which he sells as novelties to anyone with the cash to buy them. He is dressed in flamboyant clothing."
      - "A homeless man gives advice on the town and strange trinkets in exchange for coin."
      - "A cheerful dragonborn who runs a sandwich shop in a tavern. He is obsessed with incredibly spicy food, and tries to push spices on customers to ‘keep the fire burning in their stomachs’. Cooks all of his food with his breath weapon."
      - "A young half elf alchemist selling concoctions out of a small bag. Her accessories include a bandolier that holds different vials, leaf shaped earrings, and a purple headband. She promises that her creations work, however the shakiness of her voice don’t inspire confidence. She’ll get overly excited when she makes a sale."
      - "A scarred, brutish orc selling finely crafted jewelry. if engaged in conversation, he reveals that he only took up the barbaric ways of his people because of peer pressure. Eventually he went adventuring and then decided to pursue his lifelong hobby of crafting rings and necklaces and the like. His clan must believe he is long dead by now."
      - "A young human wizard, yet to lose his baby fat and with no sign of facial hair can provide advanced spell scrolls, but always refers to customers as ‘youngster’ or ‘whippersnapper’. When asked about it, he becomes very upset, muttering about curses and kids not respecting their elders anymore."
      - "A old human luthier with a grey mustache and coke bottle glasses. He’s always working on something and refuses to look away from what he’s working on for more than a second. His teenaged son does most of the dealing, however he spend most of his time playing with the merchandise. The son will keep playing when spoken to and will inform everyone that his band is playing at the tavern that night. Before making any deal he will walk over and ask his father if the deal is fair."
      - "A slender, well-mannered man sells curiosities in a travelling carriage. He has a pet mimic that has taken the form of a small lockbox, which is somehow very well trained and obedient."
      - "A female high elf with shoulder length auburn hair and named Mary Jane sells herbs, fruits and vegetables from a large wagon pulled by a pair of mechanical oxen. Many of the herbs are seasoning; some have medicinal uses and a few have ‘recreational uses’. Her partner, a shy male Halfling named Timmy who barely speaks to anyone, but, if you can befriend him, he can sell you a few herbs and roots that are useful in toxin manufacture."
      - "A sphinx who sells minor magical items in exchange for new riddles."
      - "A quick tongued elven female who has a reputation of being a snob. She often wears a colorful dress that’s skirt reaches down to her knees, several different pieces of jewelry, and a small leather bag that has the symbol of her merchant clan on it."
      - "A halfling peddler who roams town to town selling wears from his ‘many adventures’. If the party sells him something, say a blanket, they might find it for sale in the next town over. The blanket will have some story such as how hiding below it prevents ghosts and goblins from seeing you, or maybe it had kept him warm in the snow capped mountains and was the warmest blanket ever. He will be selling for three times what he paid for it at the least. If you want to add another layer of mystery. The things he says the objects can do actually happen. Aside from the obvious abilities the goods have, they are clearly the same goods the adventures and townsfolk sell him. Down to a wierd stain or carved initial. He is smart enough not to sell goods in the places he bought them."
      - "A smith, a ’90s waif who only weighs 90 pounds if she’s carrying hammer and tongs. She’s tiny, the size of a human ten-year-old. She makes big, heavy things such as plate armor, tower shields, pole arms. They’re of masterwork quality. She’s not deceptively strong, either: she can barely raise the hammer above her shoulder. There’s no enchantment or anything else involved; nobody has ever been able to figure out how she does it."
      - "A kobold sells ‘Enhanced’ potions at a discount from a dingy shop sandwiched between two larger, more reputable stores. The proprietor is somewhat vague on exactly how the potions have been enhanced. They do exactly what the label implies, though (‘Ideally,’ the proprietor insists,) they frequently come with an additional effect. This ‘Enhancement’ can range from enhancing the user’s physical and mental faculties, to making the user’s skin turn blue for hours, to making the user’s tongue taste like bathwater. A particularly intelligent user may be able to determine the side-effect before using it. The rest simply have to hold their breath, drink, and pray."
      - "A tall lanky shop owner who can’t seem to get warm. He wears several sets of clothes at once."
      - "A very grumpy half-orc who gives customers what they want, but does not take requests. His prices are excellent, but he will only sell one item of his own choosing to each PC."
      - "A toothless, vegetarian lizardfolk who sells poultices and other herbal remedies. He claims that he was cursed to have no teeth and took up a different diet out of necessity, and he grinds up his food into a puree so he can eat it properly. His scales are a sickly yellow and he’s almost always bent over his table, grinding up and boiling down various common and exotic plants, all of which he grows or buys himself."
      - "A bizarrely dressed human with a strange beard and haircut. He brews coffee and spends hours perfecting it so he could find the purest, most flavorful blend. In reality, it’s just normal coffee. When being told this, he responds by saying that they aren’t cultured enough to understand the depth of the flavor. He’s incredibly cranky and pretentious for his age, so almost nobody likes him."
      - "A dust genasi who sells a huge variety of cleaning supplies. Brooms, mops, soaps, various scented oils, you name it. He’s constantly leaving a trail of dust around and cleans it up as it gets made. When it’s pointed out that he’s doing a fruitless task, he becomes extremely sarcastic and thanks them for pointing out the obvious. Other than that, he’s pretty laid back."
      - "A Warforged merchant that sells scrap metal, logs, wagons and parts to assemble your own Warforged bodyguard. Oh, and he has some healing potions at discounted prices because ‘What would anyone use them for?’"
      - "This unidentifiable person is clad in a bright blue robe and an opaline mask. Their hands and feet are bright blue as well. They sit on a pretty standard rug, cross legged and swaying side to side. His rug is NOT for sale, because he always mentions it before talking to a customer, along with a large tag that says ‘NOT FOR SALE’ on the side. He sells various items, all with some sort of minor magical effect. He doesn’t say much except for strange things like, ‘What’s your favorite color? Mine’s blue.’ and ‘I like your haircut.’ When the party leaves, he quietly hums to himself and disappears as soon as he’s out of earshot. Nobody knows who or what you’re talking about when you try to mention him."
      - "A strangely happy man in a cart pulled by horses. He smiles extremely wide and creepily. He’ll offer free items to the party, like food, if they come into his cart and grab it. You probably should’ve noticed this was a highly advanced mimic, due to his mouth not moving when he talks and the walls of his carriage looking kinda fleshy."
      - "A quiet woman lies lazily on the back of a smooth-shelled ankylosaurus. The anky’s name is Bailey, and she’s just a big puppy dog who likes being pet. The merchant (named Rachael) sells books, and buys books. She also gladly accepts food for her anky. Bailey likes corn a lot."
      - "A triton fisherman riding the back of a colossal catfish, with a small tent on its back. He has wide variety of fish stored in small barrels in preserving salts. He and his catfish have been friends since they were both born, and he takes great offense when someone insults his fish (both the ones he’s selling and the one he’s riding)."
      - "A butcher who enjoys his job a little too much. He’s super creepy, but he hasn’t done anything wrong and he is well respected by those who’ve known him for a while."
      - "A huge man wearing sunglasses made of red quartz claims to be the best sculptor in the world. He can prove it too, all his statues are carved from the exact same type of granite and look scarily like the real thing. They always look scared for some reason too. As it turns out, he has a gorgon held hostage in his basement, and he uses her to freeze various animals and people he captures. From raccoons and chickens to cows and people, he’s kidnapping them and petrifying them. Somebody should stop him. He sells his statues for a whole lot of money."
      - "Subtle slave trader. The ‘products’ are actually transformed into animals or trinkets. Upon purchase, the trader will give the new owner a scroll or item to transform the trinket into the slave (maybe even back again). A clever way to smuggle slaves through check points and/or through lands that don’t support slavery."
      - "A cowpuncher with a heavy accent. She sells common livestock, along with a few exotic things like special built saddles and animal barding. She claims to be from a place called ‘Wyoming’, which everyone knows doesn’t exist. She’s completely sane however."
      - "A bearded chef who’s incredibly skinny despite the fact he’s always eating. He’s a very prestigious chef who’s famous for his dragon egg, orange, and tomato omelet. He has a pouch of granola clusters on him that he’s constantly munching on. He jokes about being cursed by a witch when he was younger, but he’s actually correct."
      - "You stumble upon a giant clam shell placed near a road by the beach. Knocking on it, a sleepy man opens the lid and rubs his eyes, asking who’s there. He’ll sell you things he finds in and around the ocean before closing the clam and going back to sleep."
      - "A painfully average man who sells painfully average things. Any magic items sold to him will lose their properties."
      - "A wandering hunter wielding a crossbow who will sell her wares to the party, or the nearest town. She’ll seem to travel in the same path as the party, showing signs of her travels (new scars, new pelts, maybe even a new friend)."
      - "An older human male approximately 60 years old, hulking frame, thick biceps, bald as a bowling ball and wears a gold chain running from earring to nose-ring, nicknamed ‘Bull’ runs a shop with his wife, a delicate grey-haired human woman of medium height, but thin as a rail and speaking with a raspy voice which tells of her advanced age. In this shop, you can find the finest china service sets and tableware in the province. From platters to plates, from pitchers to spoons, from cups to cutlery, everything you need to put out the best spread is available at Bull’s China Shop."
      - "A figure, roughly 5’5”, covered in heavy winter clothing. His(?) voice can be understood, but is muffled by layers of scarves. In actuality, there is nothing underneath the clothing; he’s a modified enchanted armor. They sell a huge variety of armor."
      - "A half-elf wizard with a crow on his shoulder. The wizard turns his head rapidly and jerkily to look at anything that moves, but stays silent. If a customer approaches, the crow speaks to them, disgruntled by the change of bodies between him and his familiar. They sells wants and books, typical wizarding gear."
      - "A vampire couple. They don’t feed off humans, instead coming out at night to hunt elk, rabbits, and other game so they can feed. They say it tastes like stale water mixed with iron shavings and beef broth, but they also say the bad taste is more than worth it so they stay in good standings with the mortals they live near. They sell timber as well as high quality furniture they make themselves. They’ll sell other things like knives, small whittled figures, and furniture polish, if you ask. The community loves them for being so helpful and not causing any problems."
      - "A dwarf with insane eyes, charred hair, and a lack of eyebrows. He has an insane look in his eyes, and is attempting to sell gunpowder and explosives to all who walk by. He keeps sizing up the local buildings with his eyes, especially the wooden ones."
      - "A very articulate bald man with glasses. He has an obscene amount of knowledge on the most useless things, like music and technology. He’s a comedian with a small food business on the side. He has a short and sweet wife who makes the delicious food that he sells. They have two long hair cats, who they call their sons. They use strange words and phrases that nobody else understands, like ‘acquiesce’ and ‘get dusted’."
      - "Armiton, very calm minded human who sells the crops he grows on his farm. His workers are all homunculi."
      - "A stout burly man with a slightly singed brown beard and tanned, scarred complexion; he’s wearing a faded motley cloak and sells a variety of odds and ends. When discussing his goods, he shows off the mundane objects at his stall as if they were exotic wonders. The magical items however, are dismissed as ‘silly pish-posh’ and he hardly acknowledges them."
      - "A half-elf, half-dryad who’s mother was a willow. He has long, flowing hair with flowers scattered in it. His dryad nature shows through, as patches of his skin are textured like wood and his hair is a light green, among other things. He is always sitting down, whether it’s crisscross on the floor or on a nearby branch. Around his neck is a small heart made of amber with a tiny blue flower embedded inside. He’ll sell you various traveling provisions and other useful, mundane things, like shovels and lanterns."
      - "A short haired woman with a light voice. She plays the ukulele and sings as a street performer. She’ll play any song on request, for a price. She seems to know every song imaginable by heart even when she has no possible way of knowing it, and she never falters in her performance. She NEVER lets her prized ukulele out of sight. She’s a folk hero for making an ogre run away crying after playing a song that it’s mother sang to him as a baby, among other rumors and tales."
      - "Eddy and Johny’s cabinet of curios A gnome and half-orc couple who sell small nik-naks some of which give off slight magic. (They sell things off the millions of trinket tables you can find)"
      - "A young Goblin merchant that is constantly trying to sell the random scraps and knickknacks he finds lying around from the massive burlap sack on his back. Many of his goods tend to be in poor condition or are junk, and a good amount of them were found through more liberal interpretations of the phrase “lying around”. Despite this, he is a hard worker that is just trying to make a living in any way he can manage, and genuinely appreciates anyone who acknowledges that. Those who do usually end up with better deals on more junk, as well as the opportunity to purchase first when he truly finds something of value. Every time someone browses his wares, he proudly proclaims that he’s got the best deals anywhere, despite his tendency to slightly overprice all his goods."
      - "A middle-aged Human blacksmith hawks his weapons and armor from the side of a small indoor arena that he owns. The portly man is eager to draw in customers, and is very proud of his works, inviting people in from off the streets to admire their impressive appearances. He is always eager to sell his normal merchandise, but those who wish to purchase his most ornate works must prove that they are capable of handling themselves in combat against a battered set of animated armor, and are challenged to push the construct out of the 15-foot radius arena without getting knocked prone by it. Only if you can do it will he allow a customer to purchase his masterpieces, all of which are beautifully yet practically designed, made from exotic materials that are perfect for enchanting."
      - "A tottering old Halfling woman often found heavily bundled up on the corners of busy streets. Despite being nearly blind, she sews repairs to cloaks and clothing in exchange for stories and tales. She is incredibly good-hearted and refers to everyone she meets as “Dearie”. She insists that she doesn’t need money and that the stories she hears make her the wealthiest woman alive, but her customers always tend to leave her some coin anyway. The repairs she makes seem patchwork and haphazard, but are surprisingly durable in addition to making the fabric much more homey and comfortable. All of the locals consider to be a staple of the community, and are very protective of her."
      - "An Earth Genasi and his cart of cabbages. Only sells cabbages and is mysteriously in every large town you visit."
      - "A small iron golem smith, who exclusively crafts razor sharp longswords (crit range 18-20, cost 200 gp, otherwise same as normal longswords). His hammer is actually an intelligent magic item that gives instructions to him in a way the players can’t perceive. The golem always talks about the hammer, not himself (‘he has this for sale, he would charge you that, etc.’) Upon receiving payment the golem throws the gold in a pot in the forge and later, if the party pays attention, mixes bronze into it after hours to produce gold bars, if it doesn’t know the party is watching."
      - "A blue-skinned tiefling who works as a glassblower. He has a lot of beautiful pots, jars, and bottles, all of which are made in stunning colors and dazzling designs. Aside from these, he also has glass weapons and armor. They’re really clunk, but they’re as powerful as they are beautiful. He keeps these a secret from his teenage female apprentice, named Sydney, to keep her focused on the basic craft. If asked about this, he says, ‘She needs to walk before she can run.’"
      - "A gangling, calm, quiet man who speaks slowly. He drags a cart full of various snails and snail shells. His clothing is adorned with many shells, but otherwise he dresses modestly and is kind-hearted. His name is Escar-Joe."
      - "A halfling man who runs the printing business in town. His printing press is unlike any you’ve ever seen, about the size of a carriage and constantly clicking and whirring quietly as it prints like clockwork, and where he got it is a mystery. When asked, he’ll change the subject in an attempt to sell scribing tools, like pens, ink, and paper."
      - "An orc who lives in the overgrown skeleton of a giant, sleeping in the skull. He sells game he hunts and ‘clothes’ he makes out of the bones and hides."
      - "A human child, around 8-9, with long, brown pigtails. Her name is Bethany, and she claims to be a healer. She’ll cure curses, disease, and other aliments. She’ll fail sometimes, but she’s still learning. She lives in a local monastery with several other priests. They say they found her as a baby and have raised her since, and she shows great promise for her abilities."
      - "A short, bald, wizened old man who runs a pet shop. None of the animals are in cages and are all free-roaming. Despite appearing to be conversing with the humans who enter his shop, he is actually talking to his real customers – the animals. When he completes a deal, the pets scratch or bite their new owners and pay him in drops of blood."
      - "A shaggy, humanoid shambling mound imbued with sentience by an unknown master. They can’t speak, rather carrying around a chalkboard around to communicate. They’re wearing loose common garb, but you can barely tell. They sell various herbal teas and remedies, and they’ll give you a haircut too if you ask. They have the ashes of their master in a small vial around their neck."
      - "A lizardfolk blacksmith who’s obsessed with fire. Her skin is a deep blue, and her neck and frills behind her ears are orange. She’ll cuddle up to her roaring forge at night to make sure she stays toasty."
      - "A mute tailor who is a total hermit. The clothes he sells are enchanted to become as heavy as lead if someone tries to steal them. He never leaves his house above his shop, only coming down to silently stock up his wares when nobody is around to see him. Purchases are made by putting the coins into a slot build into his desk, then the enchantment will wear off, allowing you to take your clothes."
      - "A well dressed woman with a veil over her face pulls you into an alley before commanding you to buy something. A shelf of potions accompanies her, all unmarked. If you try to ask a question, she pushes you out. If you don’t buy something, she pushes you out. Turning around after she pushes you away reveals that there was never an alley there to begin with."
      - "A steampunk dwarf artificer with two crude tentacles crafted onto a small hydrator engine attached to his lower spine. Wears a brown trench coat, bald and grey beard and drinks copious amounts of coffee. Quite friendly and talented with a blunderbuss also runs and operates Loch & Load artificing shop."
      - "A short woman who makes tea. Her tea is mostly normal, but if you ask she’ll show you all sorts of exotic plants made into tea bags. Banana leaf tea, cactus sap tea, goodberry tea, spicy honey tea, venus fly trap tea… these are getting weird."
      - "A fire genasi who’s obsessed with smoke. He sells cigars, smoked meats, and tinderboxes. He smells like smoke, his eyes and skin are a dusty orange."
      - "You open the door to a large shop, and it’s empty. Save for a single table, with a quiche. A singular quiche. There’s a note that says, ‘Pay what you want’ with a smiley face in crude handwriting. You can smell a goblin in here somewhere. Did she make this?"
      - "A man with a pet rust monster buys metal scraps and sells the chitin his pet drops. Maybe there’s a use for it. The rust monster is extremely well behaved, with little bows around its antenna. It’s kinda cute."
      - "A gruff, stereotypical strongman runs a bar. A normal bar."
      - "A dark skinned goliath woman who runs a daycare. She sells the arts and crafts that her children make that they don’t take home, and she’ll take care of your kids if you have any. Everyone calls her Mama."
      - "A young witch who smells of alcohol. For some reason, she cursed herself to be constantly intoxicated. She only uses fire magic and anything to get her more drunk."
      - "A fat man who yells a lot. He sells mead he homebrews himself. Is he deaf? Maybe he’s deaf."
      - "This kid claims to have an invisible cow, and he sells the milk. When you try and prove him wrong, a long moo comes from seemingly all around you. I guess he does have an invisible cow. Drinking the milk turns you invisible for a few minutes."
      - "This man sells wagons of all shapes and sizes. From wheelbarrows to horse drawn carriages, he makes them all by hand. He’s known for being very precise when he stains the wood, also by hand."
      - "A tabaxi with shaggy fur sells livestock, who are all acting strange and annoyed. She swears they aren’t stolen. Stop asking."
      - "A royal guard with a scrawny body and weak chin. He’ll give you the latest gossip on the town for a few coins. He’ll tell you regardless, then get annoyed when you don’t pay."
      - "An aarakocra chicken who sells healing potions. The potions are contained in eggshells and look like normal eggs, if a bit larger than the usual. The merchant will fluff up and squawk indignantly if a PC wonders whether the merchant laid the eggs. She will scratch in the dirt and wave a feathered arm angrily. ‘NOT my—bawk!—CHILDREN.’ The potions all heal an extra 2 HP, but the shells are fragile."
      - "Legitimate Larry. He’s so legitimate that his collection of obviously stole items obviously must have just fallen off the back of a cart."
      - "A Halfling Artificer and Tinker, with a broad smile and gregarious nature. He produces intricate, ingenious mechanical devices for adventurers. The shop he operates out of is built-to-halfling-scale, though. To broaden his customer base, he has fitted every shelf, display, and even the front wall of the building with a complex system of rails and slides, allowing him to do business with anyone, and display anything, all at the customer’s eye level."
      - "What appears to be an EXTREMELY tall halfling woman, but when she walks around the counter, she is simply wearing the tallest pair of platform shoes you’ve ever seen. All she sells is shoes. Some of the shoes are enchanted, but many are just ‘fashionable’."
      - "A tortle that, when it approaches, it appears the shell has been carved to look like tattoos. When he speaks, he has a deep slow tone to his voice (imagine Johnny Cash). He sells books and scrolls and writing equipment. He is never in a rush to make a sale as he enjoys the act of bartering but always ensures he makes a profit. His stock often holds rare or even forbidden books. When asked, he will just shrug and say something about not knowing or forgetting the book was there. He of course houses lots of spell scrolls at different levels and will even sell a few spellbooks from wizards that gave either passed or given up that life."
      - "Bobbik and Bimbeck’s Curiosities: Mr. Bobbik is a bespectacled Beholder with a friendly and inquisitive nature. A true oddity in his species and as such shunned entirely from polite underdark society. In his travels, he met Mr. Bimbeck, who was exploring caverns looking for interesting rocks and a lifelong friendship was formed. The two of them sell all manner of strange and unique things. They probably don’t have EXACTLY what you are looking for, but they certainly have something of interest. Example Inventory: A potted plant with a bell on it (So it can’t sneak up on you), a warhammer that you can fill with angry bees, Aardvark poison, Aardvark medicine, a clockwork thing you don’t know what it does that has a bell on it so it can’t sneak up on you."
      - "Sister Elma: She claims to be a Nun and sells holy symbols and dubious reliquaries to travelers. Example Inventory: Martyr’s Big Toe on a string, desicrated left testicle of a legendary bard, mostly accurate holy symbols at discount prices, bag of bones from a legendary warrior (or a chicken, depending on perception checks)."
      - "Bob and Rob Oblah (And Hobble their Goblin assistant): An Ettin with 4 eyes for values! Not the brightest, but with a natural sense for what things are worth and if they are being cheated or short-changed. The two heads can be played off of each other in the process of haggling. Hobble the Goblin mostly just stares daggers at the customer and polishes the counter. Example Inventory: Magic Items, hand made Goblin crafts."
      - "A new gnomish invention that automatically dispenses a piece of gum that works as a healing potion if the proper amount of gold is inserted. Roll a d20 when using the machine. On a 20, two pieces of gum come out. On a 1 the machine jams and no gum comes out. Has tamper resistance enchantments that destroy the gum if the machine is broken into."
      - "A dwarven barber that uses magical shears. Cuts their client’s hair to be longer, not shorter."
      - "A Tabaxi merchant sells beautiful glassware and fine china, things that an adventurer would probably never use. Symbols on his shop in thieves’ cant suggest he may also be a fence, although they are confusing, crossed out and re-written. The Tabaxi, a dark-coated young merchant named Many Hidden Knives, is boisterous and eager to gossip."
      - "The shopkeeper is clearly two gnomes with one on the other’s shoulders, but they will never admit it. The two, Foggi Ysbeten and Grogel Grogelhome, take turns being the one on top, but never acknowledge the difference. They sell ‘human-sized’ equipment."
      - "The Broad’s Boards: An extremely tall, stunningly attractive blonde woman named Nyss sells shields of different makes and models. Has some magic shields, some bucklers, and some tower shields too big for the average man."
      - "A Goliath, considered large even among his own tall people, known only as ‘The Builder.’ He crafts intricate toys, gadgets, and trinkets. Working from inside a wagon pulled by two Clydesdale horses, he hunches over his desk with a lantern and a magnifying glass, working his massive fingers to build tiny, detailed devices. If he meets a child, he always gives them a toy for free. He never accepts gold as payment, only more materials for crafting, or if the need arises, a personal favor. He can be commissioned to build specific devices, but prefers not to unless he knows the person well. He sticks to rural towns and villages and defends himself with a myriad of clockwork like devices that are beyond most people’s understanding."
      - "Azaeli, A devilish tradesmen. A man of true evil. Holds some of the best gear around and sells them very low as well, but they come at a cost, Azaeli gives the buyer a quest of true evil intentions. Rather it be spreading a plague, or allowing crime syndicates to florish, a seemingly useless action that has large impact on the nearby areas. Azaeli has a pair of seemingly burning eyes, is often found to be wearing a top hat and very expensive silk clothing. In his backstory Azaeli, was once a normal True neutral, human warlock, until one day Azaeli attempted to banish a powerful demon. It succeeded but as soon as he cast it he was possessed causing a merge of souls. Azaeli became a devilish sellsman who roams the globe causing mayhem."
      - "Whilst walking through through the run down boroughs of a large city you spy a strange exchange down one of the numerous labyrinthine alleys. A rather large and motley crow sits upon a busted crate. At the base of the crate an alley cat, accompanied by a scraggly litter of kittens, approaches the crow and drops what looks to be a shiny piece rubbish. You look on as both the cat and the crow seem to converse, the low cawing of the crow meeting the desperate meows of the cat. Eventually some sort of accord seems to be struck, and the crow produces a large half eaten fish, dragging it from the crate and letting it plop down on the dirty ground bellow. Immediately the mother alley cat picks up the fish and darts off, her kittens tumbling along behind her. Those who wish to stay and observe the crow for longer will discover that all manner of strays, ferals and other wild denizens of the alleys approach the crow throughout the day, including one or two beggars and street kids. Each time something shiny is produced, and an item from the box given. Sometimes food, sometimes junk, and at one point even a dagger (given to a street kid) is pulled from the crate. At sundown several more crows gather at the spot in the alley and begin to fuss around the crate. Eventually they all take flight, labouring under a sack clearly laden with goods. They cary the sack high above the roof tops, eventually disappearing from sight, their mysterious trade having officially closed for the day."
      - "A series of animals who seem to run every magic shop the party goes’s to. They’re capable of communicating via telepathy, but mostly prefer to make animal noises. Probably the familiars of some old mage."
      - "A very short wizened old man with a wispy mustache. He runs a pet shop and seems to always be talking to himself. When someone enters his shop he will grab them by the elbow and begin walking them around to all the cages and kennels and tanks. No matter what they say, he’ll respond with things like ‘Yes, he is a bit tall, isn’t he?’ or ‘Now don’t be rude, he doesn’t smell that bad.’ or ‘Ah yes, I remember. You don’t want a single pet, you want to adopt a whole family.’ Finally he gets to one animal and says ‘Eh? This one looks good to you? Excellent!’ He then picks them up out of the cage, hands them to the person – again, regardless of whatever the person is saying – and then says ‘Now there is just the little matter of payment …’. Which is when the animal bites or claws the person and then gives the store owner a single drop of blood. Because he doesn’t sell pets to people, he sells people to pets."

When the ship was attacked by pirates and his parents were killed he was taken in by the pirates as they couldn’t bear to kill him. Now a young man, he has a complicated relationship with piracy and the captain he serves under.

      - "Annie the Red – a young halfling woman with bright red flowing hair. She is as beautiful as she is ruthless.

A girl who will charm you for an evening, steal your coinpurse, and still leave you wanting more."
      - "Half-Blood Harry – Huge and hulking, with impressive tattoos and scars, Harry is someone who makes himself known the instant he enters a room.

He is not telling."
      - "Laurabelle Lee – a woman of refinement as well as class. She runs the tightest and most efficient ship possible. Every uniform is starched, every button is shiny, even the brig is clean.

She is charming, but demands respect- and her crew love her as much as they fear her."
      - "Quartermaster Berrick – a gnome who is as ruthless as he is small, rarely leaves his office aboard his ship and has mounted a large crossbow pointing at his door in case of disappointing news. While he avoids going into battle himself, his bravery and cunning is unparalleled when he’s once again in the thick of it."
      - "Dragnet – a ruthless goblin captain who’s rise to infamy came with his acquisition of a cursed fishing net. His crew is an assortment of loyal goblins and men and women who have been captured and enthralled by the net. He is clever and quick to start a fight, though quicker to use his expendable crew to save his own life. The colors of his ship depict a crescent moon with a net strung over the bottom tip."
      - "Captain Barnical Horn – a tiefling captain who was keelhauled for so long that barnicals grew from his horns now he runs in search of all of his past crew."
      - "Rubidoo – the outgoing triton jester of a large pirate crew. Since the crew hates bad puns and witty jokes, they tend to often throw her overboard to get their laughs. Because of this, she has a clockwork arm, replaced after a shark bite. Rubidoo tends to put all sorts of prank hands on her cybernetic limb, including one that lets go of its index finger when you pull it. Despite the torture from the pirates, she tends to be all fun and laughs, believing her sole job in life is to be comedic."
      - "Captain Sjondeil Darhringur – A stoic faced captain who’s been on a boat since he was born. His heritage is unclear. He captains ‘The Watcher’ a bleak storm gray galleon with grey sails. He is almost always found staring out to the horizon waiting for something that only he understands."
      - "Gulliper ‘Gully’ Blackwater – A festive halfing raider of the coastal swamps and the last son of the cursed Blackwater family. He is an amicable enough sort, willing to spare those who surrender, though he has a habit of killing any he suspects of holding magical artifacts."
      - "Honorable Captain McQuane – A former naval officer who was captured. Instead of being ransomed or killed, he led a mutiny and rose through the ranks to captain. He found piracy to his liking, but runs the tightest ship on the seas. Legend has it his crew get only an hour of shore leave a year. He’s more than willing to accept surrender or do mercenary work, and is remarkably civil and polite. He insists on being referred to by his full title."
      - "Decker – a young teen in loose fitting clothes that swabs the deck. Eager to learn the trade of being a pirate, he’s often given the work that the other seamen see as below them. He escaped a life on the street in big town and seems appreciate having a place to sleep and food to eat."
      - "Loud Tom – A boatswain with a voice like a bull and a vocabulary that is truly impressive in its creativity and range, Loud Tom hurls profanity and insults at his crew and everyone else nearly constantly. The one exception is when he is truly angry- while his verbal abuse is mostly good-natured and verbose, his wrath is nearly silent, accompanied by a facial expression that can freeze grog. ‘Loud Tom is quiet’ is a whispered warning that goes through the ship like fire and leaves everyone desperate to stay out of his way."
      - "Broadwick the Penitent – an Aasimar Swords bard with the gleam of hatred in her eyes. She killed her angelic patron in a fit of passion and sails the seas in search of a place the guilt cannot reach. Carries a Wand of Smiles that she uses on her victims just before she takes their lives."
      - "Gelionexxitrus – A beholder that lives below deck on a fleshy, living, aberration boat. Chuul patrol the deck, twitching warped humanoids work the sails. It’s hard to tell whether Gelionexxitrus and the boat are the same being."

      - "Arianis – A mad fey satyr looking for the best partiers on the material plane. Invitations to their week long hedonistic boat parties are more akin to kidnappings. If you fail to impress, you become the centerpiece/victim of the last night of the party."
      - "Revar the Fallen – An arrogant fallen Aasimar, who is easily enraged. He hates the Gods and every Culture, that still devote themselves to them in some form or fashion. He likes to especially raid temples and holy Cities."
      - "The Dread Pirate Jazeera; Captain – A dusty skinned, half-elven woman of breathtaking beauty, with black hair and supple frame. She can convince most anyone of most anything, using either intimidation or allure. She captains The Indomitable, a large ship constructed of ebonized woods. Started her seafaring life in search of the pirates who press-ganged her father into servitude, and chose piracy as a (somewhat ironic,) means to an end. Several years on, and with no leads in sight, she has all but abandoned hope of finding her father alive, and has instead turned her focus to attaining power, often through morally grey means, and plans to take revenge for her loss."
      - "Garrett; First Mate – A halfling with sandy brown locks of shoulder length hair, and an emerald for his left eye. Originally a stowaway, Jazeera saw his quick wit and cunning to be a useful trait, as he seemed able to talk himself out of nearly any corner, a fine ally to have. After sailing with her for several years, they went their separate ways, as Garrett, trained as a rogue, longed for the stage, rather than the shadows. After several years training as a bard, fate brought the two back together, and Garrett, who had lost his eye during his adventures without Jazeera, was re-instated as first mate."
      - "John; Quartermaster – A towering human male, with a few arcane tricks up his sleeve, John and Jazeera have a seething distaste for each other on the surface, but there is a mutual respect for the two in battle. John tends to err on the law and good when moral questions come up, which can often run counter to Jazeera’s plans. While the two often get into it, Jazeera recognizes power and quality when she sees it, and knows that her ship is better with John as her tactician and enforcer."
      - "Varic; Lead Gunner – A half-elven sorcerer with an affinity for lightning, Varic knows all about how to calculate the trajectory necessary to decimate his foes. As such, he was an obvious choice to lead the gunning crews. When casting spells, his veins surge with arcane energy, visible beneath the surface of his skin."
      - "Puddles; Powder Monkey – A dwarven barbarian with a fire red beard, who follows orders and has no fear, it’s natural that he’d take on one of the most dangerous job on the ship. Powder Monkeys are responsible for carrying the gunpowder for the gunning crews, and as they often had explosives in their arms, were often in a very dangerous position, should something be mishandled or dropped."
      - "Ragnar; Cook – An older man who questions his purpose and existence in life, but has a taste for food. With a long white beard and a barrel-chest, Ragnar can often be found snacking on his favorite food: chicken. Despite his aged appearance and apparent senility, Ragnar is a capable fighter when the chips are down; doubly so if his chicken is threatened."
      - "Captain Longhorn – A Minotaur pirate captain with a peg leg, long horns, and a grand, flowing beard. He carries the ship’s wheel on his back and uses it as a shield. If he’s not at the helm, the ship doesn’t move."
      - "Smeagle – A conniving, craven bo’sun of a disreputable ship, this stunted aarakocra’s wings were clipped when he was exiled from the sky."
      - "Elondrith the Puppeteer – a shady looking mass of dark rags, sporting a mask of ancient porcelain. The crew is said to be immortal, even after being hit by countless arrows and heavily woumded, they run fearlessly into their enemies arms flailing their weapons. Strangely though, they always try to aim for the arms and legs to only incapacitate their foe. Noone has ever heard elondrith utter a single command, only gestures. This is the reason they call him the puppeteer."
      - "Broggy the Vile – a half giant that assembled a crew of demihumans. Minotaurs, half orcs, goblins, you name it. Hes said to be ruthless and cruel to his foes, but fatherlike to his crew. His main weapon is a huge spiked iron ball on a chain. He is said to have sunken a pitatehunters ship by throwing his weapon once, destroying the mast and ripping a hole into the deck of the ship."
      - "Joe, no other names, just Joe – He had joined the ship as a boy, seeking fortune and fame. Over the years he toiled on deck, in the rigging, on the guns. He knows every single board and nail on this ship from bow to stern. Joe had seen his share of action, losing two fingers on his left hand in a sword fight when he was 20, his right ear in a deck fire at 25, all the toes on his right foot while sailing around the cape at 30, yet he carried on. Through his time on board, Joe developed a rigourous discipline. His white hair is kept short, cut with his own knife, and he is clean shaven despite the deep wrinkles on his aging leathery face. ‘No sense being pretty when you’re dead!’ he would say. When drunk, Joe tells stories of his time at sea, all 50 years of it. Each story has a tattoo to go with it, his skin a veritable tapestry of his life etched from his knuckles to his neck and down to his ankles. As for rank, Joe never cared for it, command was not his thing. Still, he often takes youngsters under his wing, teaching them the ropes, keeping them out of trouble. Even the captain looks up to Joe, often taking his guidance on the more complicated nautical and tactical matters. Joes advanced years did nothing to diminish his fighting ability. His ability with a cutlass is second to none and twinned with his knowledge of ships he can turn an advantage in any fight at sea. And pray you never meet the loud end of his flintlock. Nobody has ever seen him miss and lived to tell the tale."
      - "Captain Mangan – an old long-bearded man with a lot of scars. He doesn’t own a ship but claims to be a former leader of a smuggler guild. He has hidden his treasures in a secret place. He is a bit crazy and forgetful. A lot of statements where to find his treasures contradict themself. He is very proud and brags about it all the time."
      - "Jebadiah – A cabin boy who thinks himself much more important and sometimes threatening than he really is. He hates whenever someone brings up his lowly position, and thinks that he deserves more. Jebadiah tries to avoid danger whenever possible, but when his reputation is on the line will rashly leap into it."
      - "Left Shoe – A quiet, gnarled dwarf who slurs his words and drools slightly when he talks. He is clearly sick with something, and has lost much of his feeling. This has led to his killing people ‘to feel their lives.’"
      - "Jim The Barber – A Captain, originally called James the Barbarous. Got tired of correcting people who misheard it and took up a pair of clippers out of curiosity. Now runs a very profitable side-business haircutting and beard trimming; it is fulfilling enough that Jim is considering giving up piracy altogether."
      - "Molly the Red and Captain Crookshanks – Molly was born on a pirate ship and has developed a fierce reputation as a daring and fearless captain. Byron Crookshanks, the second son of a minor Duke, joined the Eirinie Royal Navy and quickly rose to prominence as a fair and punctiliously honorable naval officer. Their rivalry was marked by close escapes, heated battles, and chases over half the known world. When Eirin was overwhelmed and swallowed by the Chriam Empire, Crookshanks and his crew refused to bend the knee, and found themselves a ship without a country. The two rivals became partners during a firefight with the Criamen Navy and were wed almost immediately thereafter. Now the parents of a half-dozen children, the two run a small fleet of privateers as the Eirinie Navy-in-Exile."
      - "The Lost Fisherman – possibly just a legend that pirates tell to scare each other, The Lost Fisherman is an old Dwarf in a fishing skiff, floating out in the middle of the ocean. They say he can see your soul. There was a ship, Sharkey’s Devil, that ran across him once- three hundred blackhearted pirate veterans. Another ship found the Devil a week later, floating aimlessly. The captain and crew were dangling from the yardarms, gaffed and strung together; like a grotesque fish market, they said. The only survivors were two prisoners and the grommit, who was crazy with fear, and never left land again when they got him back- a cobbler, he is now, and a pious man. But he’s just a story, a way to get scare pirates away, right? Right? I mean, there are other ships that have supposedly had similar fates, but it is probably a story. Yeah, that’s it. A story."
      - "Captain Scrack – The goblin captain of Scrack’s Scuttler (see the ship section). He has ‘VERMIN’ burned into his cheek like a brand. Scrack is a Chaotic Good captain who is well liked by his crew. He doesn’t discuss his past, but seems to take some joy in defeating haughty nobles."
      - "Vileem Crabshanks – A goblin pirate who would gladly avoid any search for treasure, yet adventure seems to find her. Has honest aspiration to become a merchant, but faces prejudice and misfortune."
      - "Koros the Black – A (Krynn) minotaur, who aims to ravage a town and personally loot the local Duke’s Manor. In truth, he’s only after a treasure lost by his grandfather to the Duke’s ancestors, but the Code of Honor demands blood must spill as well."
      - "Sharonogue the Trident — Few know his name, but Sharonogue is the clever and ruthless Sahuagin captain of a submersible with a fully amphibian crew. The submersible has a wreck of another pirate ship strapped to its hull. Sharongue scouts out his target with a pod of sharks, then when the moment is right, his spellcasters summon a thick fog. Out of the fog, the submersible rises, looking to the opposing vessel as if a ghost ship encrusted with mollusks and water-logged has apparated before them. The above-water portion can soak up the cannon fire from their desperate quarry but the submersible inexorably approaches until Sharonoques merciless crew can board."
      - "Gatsi Shrinemason – A Dwarven Cleric of Zeboim, who builds faith and worship among all sea-goers. You can find him at work in towns or the wilds, building shrines, alters, obelisks, spreading word; or maybe just bullying his way onto a ship to go where he’s called."
      - "Crablegs – a human deckhand that always walks sideways."
      - "Amir-Sual – Once a wealthy sea merchant of the oceans of Osad, he turned to piracy after it was discovered he had used privateers to sink his competition. He has managed to bind 2 jinn to his ship so as to conquer the opal sea: A wind jinn for his sails, and a fire jinn for makeshift cannon"
      - "Rimmarie, first mate – Once a prostitute of some nowhere costal town, her life was saved by Amir when he was still just a crooked merchant, she stands by her now husband’s side on the opal sea. She is said to have made a deal with a dark jinn who wanted who helped bind two others to the ship."
      - "First Mate Shaw – a classic sword n’ board fighter with a few spell scrolls at his disposal. Shaw has a few dialogue quirks, if anyone bothers to talk to him. ‘I’m Shaw of it’ ‘How can you be sure? I’m Shaw!’"
      - "Dashu – A long term priate deckhand. An impressive climber and prefers small sharp daggers. Very competent and finds places on crews easily. Secretly he is a wererat who is first to leave his crewmates to their fates the moment things go wrong. Even if it means living as a rat in the bilges of a military vessel until next port."
      - "Deathskull the Man Killer – This pirates real name is Phill, he’s a kind man who has bad luck all around him. If he helps out other ships they end up sinking and burning down, nothing good happens around him. He is known as a man killer even though he tries to be very kind."
      - "Captain Merriatt, Elven pirate of the Azure Sea – He hunts at night, catching ships completely off guard on moonless nights. His brutal reputation is totally manufactured, he hates bloodshed. His ship, The Death Night, a dark-hulled and black sailed schooner has an enchanted brig that creates a Duplicate of its prisoners on deck. Once a ship has been taken, Merriatt takes the captain below, then returns to ‘execute’ the Duplicate in front of the captured crew. After ransacking his victim’s ship, he lets the crew go on their way. The capture captains are let off at the next safe port, warned never to to reveal the truth, or risk the lives of every other captain on the Azure Sea."
      - "Rat-Faced Bill – Bill had a vision problem ever since a bully splashed boiling water in his face when he was 9. He squints to see and he looks like a rat when he squints. Unfortunately Bill had to squint a lot. He was bullied for so long that when he turned 16 he kidnapped every single one of the 13 people that bullied him and put them in a small dinghy with no sails and no oars and pushed them out to sea. Bill then decided to become a pirate as a way to support himself and to see if he could find the dinghy. Bill rules with an iron fist but he is always fair and so his crew has much respect for him. His favorite punishment is forcing prisoners to build a dinghy out of their former ship and pushing them out to sea."
      - "Arfinkle – Arfinkle is a crafty wizard with a wicked sense of humor and even more wicked spells. His entire crew is odd bronze contraptions, fueled equally by steam and twisted magic. His favorite one is a teapot with legs and a sleep dart shooter."
      - "Last Mate – Last Mate is a sailor by trade and probably among the worst to ever attempt it. By the time he calls out ‘Land Ho’ from the Crow’s Nest, he’s already forgotten in which direction it is by the time he’s scrambled down to the deck. Last Mate also happens to never really quite recall any nautical terms whatsoever and has to be constantly reminded what port and starboard mean. However, Last Mate’s relentless enthusiasm and deep respect for the Captain helps make him a tolerable, if not slightly detrimental, member of the crew."
      - "Obum the Breaker – Former naval captain. Charismatic and popular, but mostly inept. Relies heavily on his First Mate Ideen (a warlock serving the Devil Osouro) and his boatswain Hwonk the Vile."

      - "The Flamedancer – a goliath captain with the ability to create fire. He commonly attempts to throw fire at the sail of an enemy ship to immobilise it before getting close enough to burn the rest of the ship to surrender. Works with first mate Johnson, a sorcerer with the ‘Create or Destroy Water’ spell who control flames that spread too fast or put out a captured ship. He brutally burns any dissenters and enemy captains who fight in front of his crew, as a show of force, while Johnson stands by."
      - "Rosie the Rivener – A well built and fiercely independent woman who pioneered a form of maritime execution in which the victim is lashed between two ships that then sail apart, ripping the victim in half."
      - "The Dead Pirate Roberts – A skeleton that resides in the captain’s quarters of a pirate ship called the Death Jester. He’s not animated or anything, he’s really just a skeleton. The First Mate is a spellcaster who can speak with the dead, and frequently consults Roberts for advice."
      - "Dastardly Dave Deadbeard – Elderly human retired pirate. Usually found in the corner of a tavern drinking rum and telling stories of his plundering days. Mildly partial to a glass of bison milk. Has no beard."
      - "Toruvah Hullfinder – This man’s body ripples with muscle, and his hands are like oyster-hammers. He fights bare-handed, leaping into the water and tearing holes in enemy vessels. He has an odd penchant for collecting bits of driftwood."
      - "Bertha Redbraid, the Dwarven Sea Lass – Captain of the Dread Drakkar, a longship of dwarven construction. She loves looting and sinking vessels of Elvish make."
      - "Captain Koskinen – 6’7′ tall, 320lb tiefling with dark purple skin and a great many scars. He is barrel chested and imposing, with a deep and raspy voice, but he is actually a very warm and friendly host to guests aboard his ship, which sails the great desert at the head of a fleet of lost ships driven by a great sandstorm."
      - "Shivering Sally – Just what this pirate is is unclear, since she is always heavily bundled up and complaining of the cold. She clearly has some magical connection to ice, which makes her a dangerous opponent, but mostly she is notable for the betting pool on what race she is, and who will get a look to find out."
      - "Reversal of Fortune – A Goliath with a prominent burn scar along the right side of his face. Reversal of Fortune is a powerful swordsman and cunning captain. He is also subject to a powerful curse; every two years, he is destined to lose everything he owns. He is unaware of the curse, attributing his sudden biannual losses to bad luck or twists of fate."
      - "Captain Bismuth Von Hart – a green tiefling swashbuckler in search of a way to remove the curse he has obtained. Formerly a Halfing, Captain Hart sacrficed his own appear, gaining tainted blood in exchange for a magically item/secret from a haunted island far to the east."
      - "Marquis de Lafayette – a human sailor on his way to deliver news about the war effort of (insert country here). On the weekends he does acapella with his crew. He loves whiskey, revolution, and women."
      - "Brinetusk – Orc captain of the Crackin’. Large and imposing, with a number of tattered jackets and hats taken from other captains he has defeated. His ship reflects her captain, with a number of masts and armor taken from Brinetusk’s victims grafted on to the hull. He attacks other ships on sight, crashing into them with the weight of the Crackin’ behind him, with his shamans upon their war drums, summoning storms of vengeance and destruction. Expect a great deal of plunder if Brinetusk is defeated, though some of it may be more trophies and skulls rather than gold or gems."
      - "General Taylor – once a high ranking officer of an empire (current or destroyed) he and his crew were sunk in an ambush (either pirates or an enemy kingdom) and woke up as an undead crew at the bottom of the sea. He continues to sail in his rotting galleon behind enemy lines, attacking anyone that looks like those who killed him."
      - "Archerd the Twice Drowned – A former pirate captain whose ship was destroyed by a great sea monster. Now he is back as a revenant and he and his crew will stop at nothing to kill the great beast."
      - "Ghingumuff Goldtaker – A clever and merciless goblin captain who boldly leads his crew to wealth and glory."
      - "Tavis Startoe – A human who lost an arm to a shark. With his remaining arm he wields the rapier like no other. He often mocks his foes as he duels for their inability to defeat a cripple."
      - "Topiary Fritz – a halfling man covered in new tattoos and wearing a captain’s robe several sizes too big for him. He was once the servant of a large military ship, but once the ship changed hands he just continued to work. He is incredibly kind, hardworking, and an incredibly competent chef and servant."
      - "James Rothschester (Great Old One warlock) – is a human pirate captain with short, shaggy black hair, and sunken spectral green eyes. He is less interested in treasure than he is information. He and his crew go to ancient ruins and underwater caverns in search of information about his patron. He only takes enough treasure to keep his crew happy and willingly gives up much of his share in return for their compliance."
      - "Elara ‘Forester’ – a druid torn between her love of the land and the sea. Her boat was grown of an ancient Riverside yew that wished to travel as much as she did. She hates the other ships that roam the ocean, those perverted abhorrations glued together from hundreds of innocent trees. Her ship, the ‘eldest pride’ is crewed exclusively by tree ents."
      - "Barnaby, The Barnacle – Widely believed to be the crustiest, oldest sea dog still in the business, Barnaby is an incredibly old human pirate that has made a name for himself by being the most experienced and well-traveled pirate still alive. He has been a crew member of a whole fleet of ships, having held the positions of cabin boy and captain at different points in his life, as well as everything in between. He is a knowledgeable sailor, having spent more of his life on a ship than off one, and is one of the most competent crew members a captain can hope for, with any counsel he provides consistently proving the worth his wealth of experience in piracy. However, it is worth remembering that a pirate doesn’t grow old unless they’re the cream of the crop, and The Barnacle has spent his whole life as one. He has a cunning mind that has only sharpened with age, and a vicious streak as long as a ship when the time calls for it. Many a raid has been planned with his help only for the captain in charge to disappear amidst the fighting, leaving Barnaby as the man to look to, and he has earned plenty of loot from his long years of work. The moniker ‘The Barnacle’ was not earned because of his fondness for them or their presence on his body, but because much like a barnacle, Barnaby is impossible to be rid of and will likely remain long after his foes are at the bottom of the sea. All this history has earned Barnaby a degree of infamy among the underground community, and any captain who brings him aboard treats him with the proper respect, deference, and fear to which someone in his position is entitled."
      - "Breaker of Ships – A Warforged gunner, BoS was created to serve as a living weapon for the (random country) navy. BoS slowly grew to hate this life, and when their ship was sunk in a squall, they walked along the bottom of the ocean, until they reached the infamous pirates haven, Shattersail Bay and enlisted with a crew. Now, when they are not blowing up (random country’s) ships, they are studying the occult, using their share of the booty to acquire dread occult artifacts."
      - "Lady Aliana Ismal – When the Hallowed Empire collapsed in the fires of revolution, the loyalist sailors and marines of the 2nd Hallowed Fleet found themselves without a cause or a leader. The former was fixed when Lady Aliana Ismal, a human warlock, arrived and seized control of the fleet with the aid of eldritch monsters, and her connection to the former royal family. Now the Unhallowed Fleet ravages the newly independent states out of a desire for loot and revenge. Rumor has it that Lady Ismal seeks to use the loot to acquire an army fit to restore the Empire to its former glory."
      - "High Priest Kandi – Kandi ( a dwarven priest) and his band of followers are disciples of the Ocean God, Leviathan. Kandi’s home island was once invaded by a ship full of greedy adventures, who were only repelled at great cost. In order to prevent future attacks, KAndi and a group of his acolytes were ‘blessed’ by Leviathan with the ability to turn into weresharks and sworn to protect the people of their island from future interlopers. Kandi’s crew maintains a small gallon in order to fool incoming ships, but this is a distraction to allow the weresharks to get close to the enemy boat and board. Most of the time Kandi is content to scare ships off, but sometimes he is forced to destroy ships with all hands aboard, in order to protect his home."
      - "Squabbles – a seemlingly timeless elf-ish man, though it’s hard to tell he’s an elf. His hunched back, yellowed fingernails and eyes, and wrinkled leathery skin almost looks monstrous from a distance. Speaks in a slurred Primordial that, even when understood, is not properly understood. He’s never been asked on the ship, and he always complains about ‘poor spoils,’ without ever asking for them. At port, he gets off the ship with the rest of the crew, and wanders back onto another ship, with no regard for loyalty of crew. Mediocre at washing, but entertaining, unique, and most importantly: free labor. However, captains are cautious of him, and some seem to listen exceptionally intently to his ramblings, sometimes even going so far as to invite him to sleep his ship duration in the captain’s quarters. Occasionally after a long night of slurred ramblings, captain’s may abruptly change their course, asking advice from the old crouch. Rarely do they find anything… that they speak of…"
      - "Seeker Malorie – a halfling Deckhand with a badly scarred face, extending to the top of his head effecting his hair growth noticeably (think scraggly). he has a Flase eye that seems to just look around on its own, but quickly snaps into line with the other eye when someone mentions treasure."
      - "Rigmonkey Soliel – a half-elf girl who grew up in a traveling circus and was taken up by pirates after it burnt down. She dances up the rigging of the ship, keeping balance in the fiercest storms. She has a quick tongue and a fiery temper."
      - "Slick Willy – An enormous, intelligent eel who signs on with pirate crews, accompanying their ships to attack other craft from beneath the waterline and defend against aquatic threats in exchange for bodies thrown overboard."
      - "Teth-Makina – A githyanki pirate slumming it in the Prime Material, stealing gold on the open ocean rather than godflesh on the Astral Sea for a change of pace. Her ship’s figurehead is the actual head of a zombiefied dragon which breathes necrotizing green flames. Way overqualified for what she’s doing here."
      - "Deephost Margot – An aspiring pirate-queen who sought power through symbiosis with a creature of the lightless depths. She must consume alchemical drugs regularly, both to make her body an amenable environment for the creature and to sustain her organs crushed by its occupation of her torso, and in return gains access to its abyssal magic."
      - "Ulixes the Tidesworn – A sea-priest who pirates not for wealth, but to ritually enact the supremacy of water over land. A peerless navigator who finds his way by revelation rather than reason."
      - "Long Don Clamber – Born to a port whore and raised in the shadow of Jolly Rogers, has always dreamed of becoming the most infamous pirate the seven seas had ever seen. Has had impressive exploits as part of the crew of several notorious pirate captains, but never managed to afford a ship of his own due to blowing his earnings on magico-surgical alterations to make his form more piratey. Has a hook-hand that can fire off a grappling hook, gills and an organ that lets him drink seawater, a liver that can handle any amount of grog, expandable peg legs, a monkey’s tail attached to his back, and so on."
      - "Gurglesploosh – A water elemental playing at being a pirate, as it seemed like the most entertaining thing mortals did on the waater. Gurglesploosh doesn’t really understand important (to mortals anyway) concepts like “crime”, “ownership”, or “death”. Starting to enjoy the feeling of blood diluting within its body."
      - "First Mate Jeremy Jenkins – His captain has been dead for 5 years. Despite sailing with and leading the remaining crew, Jeremy hasn’t taken the captain role out of respect."

      - When the aasimar draws her weapon against a wicked foe, it ripples with light as if moments from being set aflame. If the aasimar is a sneaky sort, reflections of a tremendous shadowy thunderhead appear instead. Clashing weapons or shields with an ideological opponent causes the aasimar’s weapons and gear to throw a torrent of sparks.
      - The aasimar never makes misspellings or simple grammatical mistakes in her writing ever. Her handwriting is swift yet flawless. Even the aasimar’s signature is charismatic.
      - The aasimar can instinctively tell if a written contract presented to her has deceptive intent. The aasimar notices the overall malice of the author hiding within the handwriting and parchment, but the aasimar must use her own wits to discover the precise catch.
      - When the aasimar concentrates on a small cloud for a long time, it slowly shapes itself into a rough impression of what the aasimar desires. (Cannot be used for skywriting, the precision is too demanding.)
      - The aasimar has a knack with much loved heirlooms. The rust on heirloom armor simply flakes off with a little care, grandpa’s broken clock starts running again with a little tinkering, and a child’s ripped stuffed animal practically sews itself together.
      - If the aasimar takes ten minutes to attune to a location where a worship service was held in the past day and night, she can hear pieces of the worship service that took place. This sense works even when the aasimar is deaf.
      - The aasimar always includes a little mud or spit in her medical care. The healing doesn’t work as well when the aasimar leaves them out, but the recipes don’t perform when other people try to make them.

      - Any silk cloth they wear for a day makes it nearly impossible to be zombified when used as a burial shroud.
      - If they sneeze into a pure white handkerchief, they can open it to release a dove, who flies away. Sneezing into a normal handkerchief turns it pure white
      - If they focus, their ears are able to hear any prayer or cry for help in 100 feet, no matter the sound level or other distraction.
      - They cry tears of blood, which paradoxically cleans any object used to wipe them away.
      - On sunny days, they sparkle a little in the light, as if they had been dusted with glitter
      - People who sleep near the aasimar find that they sleep more restfully and contentedly than they have in a long, long time.
      - Jokes they tell are just funny. No explaining it. Even the worst, most unfunny joke told by the aasimar is met by a wry chuckle.
      - If they touch the face of a dying enemy, they get advantage on checks made to convince them to release the information the aasimar seeks.
      - Once per day, re-roll a failed ranged attack made against an enemy – the projectile has inexplicably bounced off of nearby objects to strike the enemy from behind!
      - They can attune to an object to make it hum an accompanying melody to a song of their choosing, with a range of 30 feet.
      - If they trip or stumble, they always find something interesting on the ground in front of their face – a gold coin, a perfectly round stone, a piece of wood that kind of looks like a religious figure.
      - The aasimar can sleep under blankets comfortably even on the hottest, must humid evenings.
      - They’ve never lost a thumb war, and can always guess how many fingers you’re hiding behind your back.
      - People nearby the aasimar can now detect untraceable poisons in their food, with just enough time to react.
      - Dirt, grime, and sludge is wicked away from their clothing.
      - Their touch can relieve the elderly of their aches and pains for a week
      - Criticisms and observations made by the aasimar convince the target of the comments to turn their life around and improve their situations.
      - Light always reflects in a way that makes them appear as if they are standing in a column of heavenly light, even if the reflections are not logical.
      - Their teeth are always pearly white, and never fall out. Their baby teeth grow as the rest of them does, and they always fall perfectly into place throughout the growth process.
      - Dirt and debris seem to be physically incapable of sticking to their body. Coming into contact with anything of the sort results in the offending material sliding right off of them.
      - When in love, a faintly colored glow hangs in the air around them and gently reaches out towards the object of their affections whenever they are nearby. The exact color of the glow is unique to the individual aasimar.
      - Whenever they feel indignant, righteous, or justified, the faint pounding of drums can be heard echoing around the minds of all those nearby. The speed and intensity of the drumming increases with the strength of their passion.
      - When someone of the opposite gender approaches an Aasimar, they get “hot under the collar” and are more likely to do things for them.
      - Depending on their ancestry, an Aasimar’s general appearance will be vastly different from another. If they’re a descended of a Celestial or other holy being that was related/associated with the sun, then their body might give off a soft glow at night, their iris may look like an actual sun slowly revolving, and/or they have a greater affinity to heat.
      - An Aasimar may have two vertical lines going down their back near their shoulder blades as if there use to be wings there.
      - If an Aasimar lays under an old tree that tree will become more vibrant and alive as well as being able to bear fruit after the Aasimar leaves.
      - Aasimar and Tieflings can sense one another within 200 ft of one another.
      - The weather always seems to reflect the mood you’re in that day. It’always sunny when you’re happy; raining when you’re sad; and when you’re angry, there have been horrific storms
      - The smell of freshly baked bread follows you wherever you go.
      - Inexplicable memory for things that happened years before their birth.
      - Innately knows the spell calm emotions and can use it once per day.
      - Always knows the direction and distance to the nearest place of worship.
      - They cannot get drunk, and all alcohol tastes vile to them.
      - Any string instrument they play is instantly tuned to perfection.
      - When they sing, it sounds like a hundred voices singing in perfect harmony.
      - You dream of a wonderful, serene place whenever you sleep. If someone sleeps nearby or with you, they join you there.
      - If you ask a direct and honest question, people are made visibly uncomfortable by telling you a lie or hearing one being told.
      - Your finger nails mend and clean the things they scratch, can’t break, and are always just the right length for you.
      - You are not truly an Aasimar, just a common human who has deluded themselves into believing they are. Any magical aasimar traits you use are just you subconsciously casting spells.

      - A well-dressed woman says that she had the object of your search in her shop right now. Once you get in, she began a presentation about how her patented liniment of castor oil, camphor, and 7 secret herbs and resins will cure all your ailments and change your life.
      - You asked a monk if he’s seen what you’re looking for. He hasn’t, and you interrupted his prayers.

      - A group of children were roughhousing, pretending to be adventurers. They stared open-mouthed as you approached them, as if seeing a celebrity, but acted shy when you came too close.

      - An old woman said she’s sure her nephew knows, but you had to remind her several times why you approached her in the first place. When you arrived at her nephew’s home, he thanked you for bringing the old lady back but didn’t know anything that could help you solve your problem.
      - You passed a bard with limp black hair and thick eyeliner. His voice was barely audible above his sad guitar. When you asked him if he’s seen anything he told you that no one sees anything, we are all puppets with our strings cut, washing downstream, waiting to drown.
      - An excitable elderly man gave you specific and detailed instructions to a building. They sell jars of maraschino cherries, and they didn’t have any information.

      - You saw someone with the worst haircut you’ve ever encountered. You briefly forgot what you were looking for as you marveled at just how bad this haircut was. You couldn’t even put into words just how unflattering it was and you become exasperated trying to explain to the rest of the party how deeply disturbed you are that someone left the house looking like that.
      - You met another party of adventurers. They asked you about answers to their own quest first, and then you asked them about your own. You couldn’t help each other, so they wished you luck on your quest and bid you a sincere goodbye.
      - You spotted a group of youths who tried to look as innocent as possible as you walked past. You’re not even sure what they were guilty of, they just looked like trouble-makers, but definitely not worth the hassle.
      - A gnome in the tavern swore he knew all about what you’re looking for but can’t remember anything of use for less than 3 top-shelf drinks. He talked about many things before he fell asleep, none of them pertaining to your questions.
      - You asked a normal-looking gentleman if he knew anything, he looked at you wide-eyed, and gasped. ‘You can see me? You can really see me?!’ Before you can answer he’d run away, lost in the crowd. That was the last time you saw him.

      - As you posed questions to a local merchant, you notice a woman, her hood pulled up against the sun, staring at you unblinkingly. On confronting this suspicious behavior, it is revealed that she was simply staring into space, contemplating dinner.
      - A child said he knows a very bad secret, but none of the grownups would listen to him. He showed you his father’s cache of wood relief carvings, each crudely carved with images of improbably-proportioned women performing lewd acts. This was a waste of time, they weren’t even carved very well.
      - A six-year-old girl told you she knows something very important, then sagely informs you on the anatomical differences between boys and girls. She wandered off before you could react.
      - A street urchin said he had some inside information, but he couldn’t remember properly until you gave him a few coins. He said loudly that you’re a creep for trying to pay him off, and smugly walked away as people stopped what they were doing to stare. When they went back to what they were doing without questioning you, you suspected that you weren’t the first one to fall for this trick. The boy was long gone by then.
      - You felt like the locals were viewing you strangely. Like they knew something you didn’t. When you finally cornered one into an admission, they informed you that your waterskin had been leaking, making it look like you wet your trousers.
      - A man smiled at you knowingly but refused to answer any of your questions. A helpful passerby told you that this man is the village idiot, and that he always smiles like that.

      - A foreigner didn’t know anything but dammit, they wanted to be helpful. So they just filled in their gaps of knowledge with anything they could think up.
      - A woman was walking strangely, changing her course for no apparent reason. She didn’t appear to be drunk. Turns out she compulsively avoids cracks in the pavement and didn’t have any information for you.

      - Vincent Tallman, three gnomes wearing a large overcoat, were trying to pass as a human. It doesn’t seem very convincing but no else seemed to notice. You’re not even sure why they were doing it but they never broke character, insisting that they were, in fact, a perfectly normal human adult. Even when one of the gnomes sneezed and the whole lot of them nearly toppled over.
      - A shadowy figure lurking in the darkest corner of the shadiest pub in town turned out to be a hat and coat hung up on a rack. That was the closest you got to any useful information.
      - A young man was sitting in a pillory, a broken lute at his feet. ‘Tasteless Scatological Jokester’ was written on a sign next to him. He did not look repentant. Perhaps even a little proud of himself. He did not know anything.
      - You find a dead body. You must stay as a witness for the local law enforcement, for 2 d6 X 10 min. Relatives eventually show up. The person died of perfectly ordinary natural causes related to a pre-existing medical condition.
      - A watchman follows you around acting like he thinks you’re a criminal, and frightening off your contacts. When you confront him, he says he’s bored and you looked suspicious, and then wanders off.
      - An old man in a tavern who declares that he will lead you to the local tavern with the best gossip so you can ask around there. He takes you out back, walks around to the front, and reenters through the main door. He got a laugh from the regulars.
      - “Marv the Magnificent”, a street performer who very loudly and extravagantly boasts to be the most mind-bogglingly talented juggler in all the land. You put off your investigation to watch for a few minutes. He’s ok.
      - A young girl is throwing pebbles at you. She will follow you for a good ways and will continue to pick up pebbles. The adults who recognize her tell you that you look like the neighbor she doesn’t like. The neighbor happens to be totally ordinary but does look a bit like you.
      - Three kenkus are following each other and mimicking each other with different accents and personalities. They are now mimicking you because you tried to ask them some questions.
      - Two people leafing through a manuscript in complex code with elaborate artwork of maps, exotic places, and mysterious artifacts. Each page has a different font, layout, and art style. After eavesdropping, you discover they are a scribe and author picking out a format and font. The manuscript is the scribe’s stylebook filled with nonsense.

      - A pigeon with unusual coloring. You kept trying to get closer to see better, but the flock kept flying away. Eventually the flock mingled with another and you noticed several similarly unusual birds. It must be a common local mutation.

It is suspected that he dumps all his victims into the river, so he can take the form of secretly deceased servants. The only way to identify him is that he coughs up blood."
      - "A demon-possessed (undead, looking the same as when he was tombed) body of a former king arises when the kingship is to be passed to his younger brother. This body is that of the new king’s dead father. Not sure whether the king is himself, an imposter, or – Heaven forbid – demonic undead, he requesting all manner of people (religious, educated, business, peasant, fighter, doctor, and so forth) to come and look at him."
      - "The prince is found out to be insane at the age of a young adult, calling every flower ‘his princess’ and demanding a funeral every time one dies. If anyone makes the horrid mistake of picking at least one in the royal gardens, then the strolling prince takes one of the many swords hanging on the wall charges at the cast, intent on killing everyone (killing every sentient and non-sentient member, except those plant races who have flowers on them)."

      - "Several of the court’s mid-tier advisers are in a polyamorous relationship. They enact complicated (but benign) plans to hide this, but everyone in court already knows — they just don’t care. (Possible complication: a deception becomes not-fully-benign and someone gets hurt or dishonored)"

Thing is, the kingdom is having a great run ever since the chicken came along."
      - "The new court chef sold his soul to an agent of an archdevil of the Nine Hells who has now come to collect his fee. Only by poisoning the royal family can he delay his doom and continue to enjoy the fruits of the material plane."
      - "The prince fell in love with a lady of a rival noble family, the king is furious until he dies of natural causes. The prince takes his place on the throne but the new queen is really calling all the shots. She begins putting her family in power until the prince finds out that his father didn’t die of old age, he was poisoned."
      - "The king has two children that are both equally qualified to take over his throne. One would use the throne for good and is upstanding, but wishes to become a travelling bard. The other wants to send the country to war and is a real jerk."
      - "The king, against his family’s wishes, marries a peasant girl who appeared to him as sweet and pleasant. In reality she is huge manipulative, puppet master who manages to rule everything through him. It only gets easier as the king’s mentality deteriates with age, and its up to his family members to expose her actions."
      - "A female noble follows through an arranged marriage to successfully form an alliance. Her brother, the heir, and her husband, the heir of the other kingdom, are not only head over heels for each other, but also completely useless as rulers. So now she must not only help cover up their affair, but manage two lands on her own."
      - "Everyone wanted great aunt Hilda’s stuff upon her death. She however felt none were worthy with their corruption and greed, so she turns to immortalizing herself until the family finally produces a worthy heir."

      - "The royals have been getting incredibly sick lately, and nobody knows why. Each one of them has a different illness."
      - "The former queen, the current queen’s mother, has passed away. Her will is incredibly bizarre."
      - "All the royal guards quit at the exact same time."
      - "The family is trying to get their portrait painted, but they’re so picky that nobody has been successful in meeting their standards."
      - "The prince is going bald and is doing his best to hide it. He’s not doing a good job."
      - "The princess is going through the dreaded ‘terrible twos’."
      - "Somebody vandalized the palace, and now the king is personally seeking revenge. He’s far too old for this."

      - "The (family member) wants a taste of peasant life."
      - "The King and Queen are utterly corrupt and the prince knows he’s the only one who can save the kingdom. The only problem is, he was never properly educated or trained and is completely inept."
      - "The King or Queen has a soft spot for small yappy dogs. S/he collects them and the Royal household is overflowing with the beasts. They bark incessantly, bite everyone, and the maids are nearly ready to quit due to all the extra cleaning necessary. In addition, the whole palace seems to smell like urine."
      - "The King / Queen is a budding horticulturist and spends a lot of time gardening and trying to breed new fruits or other crops. An entire section of the Parade grounds has been turned into a vegetable garden, and the royal flower gardens are now a small orchard. The rest of the House Hold feels as though that is beneath their dignity and would love to have the Royal Gardens under the care of a ‘proper’ gardener and the Captain of the Royal Guard wants ‘his’ courtyard back."
      - "The Princes Royal have harbored a grudge ever since they were toddlers and are always fighting. Stemming from a time when the elder brother struck the younger over the head with a wooden soldier he was playing with, they disagree on everything. The King is aging, and many wonder if the Princes will also fight over the succession…"
      - "Someone in the royal household has been discretely stealing food from the Royal Larder. The Head of the Royal Staff is looking intently, but has found no evidence it was any of his staff. Secretly one of the Royal Children has been giving food to the poor late at night hoping no one would notice a few missing items."
      - "The King and Queen are both from rival houses that married to settle unrest in the Kingdom. Fortunately, they have grown fond of each other and are truly willing to let the past be the past. However their plethora of uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces are not. It seems that early every day someone must bring up a wrong done to them in the past and seeks righting of said wrong. These petty complaints range from a hundred year old duel to the death all the way who has the rights to next weekend’s retreat in the hunting lodge (it’s really just a shack in the woods and no one really likes it, but it’s the principal of the thing)."
      - "The Queen Mother (current King’s mother) threw a party for her favored courtiers and the young princes not only refused to show up, but also insulted her parties calling them ‘dry, boring, and serves terrible tea’. Many monocles were popped and many ruffs ruffled. Now the Queen Mother is lodged in her rooms and won’t come out and the young Princes are being forced to stand in the hall ways holding buckets of tea at arm’s length. Everyone is in a foul mood and the servants are stepping lightly."
      - "A noble family in a bunch of debt marries off their daughter, the dowry serving as a last resort to pay debts. Not long before marriage, the daughter’s face is disfigured on a horrible accident, and the groom to be calls the wedding off."
      - "The prince/princess is being forced into an arranged marriage, but they are gay."
      - "There’s been a number of rebellions that have risen up recently, little does anyone know that it’s in fact the current monarch that’s been funding them, as they don’t want to be King/Queen anymore. The Monarch has been funding the rebels in exchange for allowing them to live a simple life after the rebellion has succeeded."
      - "Traditionally, the heir to the throne is the current monarch’s eldest child, however the current monarch decides that they want another one of their children to become heir, instead of their eldest. The family and their advisors are split as to whether they are allowed to do this."
      - "In a night of drunken commoner-style revelry, the prince gambled away the crown jewels at a village tavern. All he can remember about the jewels’ new owner is that they were merely traveling through the kingdom and would be gone by daybreak. With each passing day, the chance of recovering the jewels lessens…"
      - "The royal family was lost at sea. The dead king’s younger brother and wife find themselves and their children as the sudden and unexpected new royal family."
      - "The queen has gone mad with grief. Each year she selects a new child from among the townsfolk to live a princes life, in place of her long lost son."
      - "The king refuses to stop starting wars. It’s like he never wants to hangout around his family and court."
      - "The current king sits on a precarious throne, having usurped it from his predecessor in a coup. He now lives in paranoia that the same fate will befall him."
      - "The daughter of the king has completed a rite of passage to earn the throne after his passing, but the eldest son has not returned from journey abroad, or even heard the news of the kings passing. His looming return casts an ominous shadow over the new, possibly temporary queen."
      - "To the people, it is clear that the king has no power and has been puppeteer by his council. These council members are routinely found guilty of corruption and mismanagement and tried by the people—sometimes even executed. In reality, the council holds no true power, and the king rules through his close relation to the commander of the guard. He purposefully blames the council so the people do not suspect or overthrow him."
      - "The king is in fact no true king, however only a man so delusional that he walked right in and proclaimed himself as such. The people, being too polite, have not bothered to correct him and allow him to parade about town. No one seems willing to break the joke to the party."
      - "The previous monarch died and left no direct heir—instead, only four rival houses each loosely related to the royal bloodline vie for power. The regency council has been too distracted to choose a true successor, for it fears the retaliation of the others if it sides with any individual."
      - "The king believes in the justice of chance above all else. Whenever he is told of a crime, he demands that the criminal is tried in an elaborate gauntlet that effectively boils down to a coin toss—are they innocent and let free, or are they guilty and punishable by death? The people vary in their agreement with this; some will falsely report enemies in the hopes of killing them, while others refuse to report any crimes as to not carry that burden on their backs."
      - "Having suffered a terrible accident in battle, the king has been mutilated beyond human recognition. He threatens any who dare to mention his deformity with execution but refuses to cover it."
      - "The current king isn’t a king at all, he’s a very good lookalike who has been forced into this situation when the old King disappeared. Or something"
      - "Two neighbouring kingdoms frequently use commoners in a giant game of chess and the people are becoming sick of it."
      - "A special flower used in the anniversary of the Queen no longer grows and the date is coming up soon. The court haven’t told the King yet and they fear what will happen if there aren’t any of these flowers at the celebration."
      - "The Queen is unable to bear children, a surrogate must be found but also the Queen must look as though she is pregnant to keep up appearances."
      - "The Queen has not been seen in weeks and the King is adamant that she is ‘working hard on her work’.. It is suspected that he has killed and eaten her to gain power through some ritual."
      - "The Prince did something and thought he got away with it but believes his sister may have seen it. You need to read her diary to see if she knows what he did. There can be no witnesses."
      - "The second Prince’s firstborn is a bastard, legitimized the day before the first Prince and his heirs all die in one day."
      - "The current King is toying with the idea of Democracy, his heirs are divided on this issue."
      - "The Queen has been captured by the ruler of a nearby kingdom. For the eighth time this year."
      - "The princess has been captured by an evil (insert evil stereotype here) and they have fallen in love."
      - "The king is actually an impostor who has been effectively hiding who he is."
      - "An evil usurper took the throne and killed all the heirs except a baby who was valiantly rescued … now that heir is gathering an army to take back the throne. Except, it turns out the baby actually was killed, and a random child was substituted to give the resistance legitimacy."
      - "The old king died without living children. There are a couple of reasonable claimants (e.g. one for each alignment in the party or something, plus an obvious antagonist), but they could really use a lost McGuffin to cement their claims … but when the party finds it, it is in the possession of a petrified (and thus revivable) better claimant."
      - "The king’s older brother turned down the throne and disappeared into a life of adventuring. Now with the king in ailing health, a young adventurer approaches claiming to be the child of the older brother and rightful heir to the throne. The king’s offspring are worried about this outsider taking their kingdom from them."
      - "There are rumors that the king’s oldest son isn’t his. The queen had become pregnant surprisingly soon after being rescued from a rival kingdom/ barbarians. The king had never questioned it, having raised him as his own. However, rumors continued to be spread among the kingdom. The other princes see this as an opportunity to bring doubt to his claim as heir to the throne."
      - "The Princess is a fashion trendsetter! She accomplishes this by having everyone else that tries to oppose who fashion trends assasinated."
      - "The Queen has undergone a sudden and dramatic personality shift. She has ordered the execution of her youngest daughter, and the King seems to suddenly be too scared of her to interfere."
      - "Rumors of the Virgin Queen Velor being pregnant has been confirmed by the presence of a new swaddling in the court. While the birthing was traumatic, the mother and baby are reported to be very healthy, and the energetic Queen appears to be doubly revitalized pushing her ambitious reforms with a new verve. Of course, the Queen is quick to take offense to any hint of slander related to the baby’s parentage, something that is difficult to ignore given the child’s… fiendish appearance. The priests of the Temple of Searing Light are scrambling to properly address the Royal Legatee in their next homily, with hardliners threatening to withdraw their support to the crown, but the Queen’s loyalists on the street appear willing to squelch any grouse with staunch speechifying and fists if necessary."
      - "The King was widowed recently, he feels so sad that he has recluded himself in his palace and he has lost any interest in his family or the kingdom. His councelor is taking advantage of the situation and is making the king pass any ruling he wishes to under the excuse that is to honor the deceased queen."
      - "There are worshippers of the old faith within the courthouse, the queen is one of them and she is instructing the heir prince in the old ways, this is unknown to most people including the king. Meanwhile the youngest prince is studying to become a priest of the new faith with the King’s brother, the bishop."
      - "Nobles are pressuring the King to pass a ruling that will hurt commoners. The only person that seems to be holding the king back is his mistress, a commoner herself."
      - "To build his way to the throne, the king had to poison his older brother and his son, faking a church’s permit to marry his cousin and even betray his own father. He could have kept all his sins in secret but he has been talking in his sleeps and some night servants had been spreading his words as rumours."
      - "The second prince has gotten into a shameful new habit that is embarrassing the rest of the royal family. The practice, which involves inhaling Drakevapor through a strange magical device before blowing it out, is highly frowned upon by most of the kingdom, and these “vapers” are exposed to silent condemnation by everyone else in the nation. The king is desperately trying to stop the young prince’s unbefitting behavior, but the prince is persistent in his “passion” and his general unpleasantness."
      - "During court, a glamor fails a member of the royal family revealing the individual to be a grotesque extra-planar creature, threatening to cause a panic. Unbeknownst to the populace the entire royal family are actually an alien race that are largely responsible for five centuries of a halcyon age that this recent incident might end."

      - "One winter it was so cold that the dawn froze solid. The sun normally rose between two mountains, but the ice had built up so much that it stuck firmly in place. The first sunbeams of the day had frozen up like golden icicles. A ranger named Dav Oket was coming home from a successful night hunting with a fresh owlbear. Seeing the sun frozen in place, and being a smart man, Dav knew he had to do something quickly or the world would plunge into chaos. He swiftly sprinted up the frozen sunbeams and used the heat of the owlbear carcass to melt the ice. Dav gave the sun a kick to dislodge it, lit his pipe on the sun, and slid down the sunbeams with the owlbear right to his front door. He even kept a bit of the sunrise in his pocket to remember the occasion."

It looks like a great brown snake 90 feet long, with two huge ears coming out the sides of its head and jaws large enough to swallow a man in one gulp! Some say it has hundreds of small legs that make it kind of skitter across the ground, but it can swim faster than a horse can gallop. Sometimes it sneaks up on swimmers, and if it’s not hungry it just pulls them under and lets them go. Of course old Dav Oket heard about this monster and bet his friends that he could take it on. After days of stalking, Dav finally had a shot with his bow. He was a crack shot, but not an arrow found its mark. The Monster scuttled forward and ate Dav’s bow! So the ranger wrapped his arms around the beast and wrestled with it. The fight was so great, so colossal, that it stirred up a storm over the lake. Finally, Dav threw the Monster over his shoulder, and it sailed right over the mountain. To this day, you can cross the lake in safety if you call out, ‘Old Dav’s a-coming!’ and the Monster swims away to the bottom of the lake."

      - "You served as a squire to the younger son of a local lord, a minor political figure. Two years ago he moved to the city, to study magic and indulge in debauchery, and released you from your service (and your salary). You’ve heard that Bordertown has uses for someone with skill of arms, and so you’ve hopped onto the first coach available."
      - "You’ve always wanted to be an adventurer. You sat on your pappy’s lap as he told and retold the tales of your uncle Algar Spiderspear, and your great uncle Kenway Fireheart, and your great great aunt Thea Earthforger. You didn’t understand that those were meant to be cautionary tales, and that there’s a reason you don’t have any cousins."
      - "You never really liked the family dye business. As the first born you were always expected to take over. After lamenting one night drunkenly at the tavern you met a gnome who promised to help. On returning home your family did not recognize you and your younger sibling was set to inherit. They drove you off their land to homelessness. You never saw the gnome again."
      - "You were a normal farmer, nothing special about you. Over the years, your farm started losing money and you had to let more and more of your staff go until it was just you left. One day when you are at the local inn drinking your problems away and adventurer walks through and buy the entire inn several rounds of drinks from his large sack of golden coins. Since that day you have sold your farm and used the money to buy some basic adventuring supplies and head out to build your fortune."
      - "You were a squire for the local knight and Lord of your province. One day while cleaning his library you come across and gold handle behind some dusty books.

      - "You grew up as a milk maid, over the course of your child hood you realised that you had a special connection with all animals and nature. One day on your way back from town bandits jumped out from the side of the road and attacked you. Startled, you this your hands out towards them and magic shot out from your finger tips. The next day you packed your things and headed out to learn more about what you had just done and how to control it."
      - "Your father was a miner, your mother and innkeeper, you spent your childhood poking the ashes in the fireplace waiting for something to happen. One day a halfling fell down your chimney and talk you into hiding him in your room, his only name that he gave you was Miro, but he taught you many thing over a few nights, once he felt ‘it’ had blown over he packed his things and invited you to join him.

Until one day he set you up, and ran away with the treasure leaving you to rot in the king’s jail."
      - "You always had anger problems, then again most sailors do, yours were a bit different though. One day you were fishing off the side of your ship when you caught something very heavy on your line. When you finally reeled it in you found a gold ring, but the gold was almost blood red, and in you hand it felt like it had almost no weight. Your crew members wanted to see the ring, but they only saw it as normal gold, you saw it for something much more incredible. When they tried to take it from you you flew into a rage beating them senseless until you jumped into a rowboat and made your way back to shore. You know that they will probably come after you, but none of that matters, you know that you must go to the mountains. You just don’t know where or what a mountain is."
      - "You grew up on a small farm. Your family was poor, but you managed. You idolized your older brother as a child, even though he wasn’t always nice to you in return. Then one day your brother was conscripted into the army, and you haven’t heard from him since – none of the money he promised to send home, not even a letter. You have finally come of age yourself and set out to find him, or at least find out what happened to him."
      - "When you were a teenager, you stopped by a fortune teller’s stall at a festival, just out of idle curiosity.

      - "You were a middle-aged craftsman/woman with a successful business, several children, and a happy life. One day you came home to discover your spouse was cheating on you. Newly divorced, you had a bit of a mid-life crisis and spent all of your savings on a (book of magic/set of shiny armor/fencing lessons/musical instrument/etc). Gosh darn it, you want to have an adventure!"
      - "Your parents are scholars, historians specifically, and you’ve been raised on countless trips to archaeological digs, libraries, and lectures with them. You may or may not have taken to the studies as much as they’d like, but when the restless need to spread your wings and get away from home took hold, they were excited to request that you document all the things you discover on your adventures and bring them home to share."
      - "You were the oldest child of a prosperous peasant. You had a life of beer, bread and barn dances to look forward to.

Too bad the Goblin Wars are over now and your lord disbanded his army."
      - "You were a slave, on a big estate. One day, a charismatic leader got the slaves to rise in rebellion. You’re pretty sure there are others who didn’t end up crucified, but you’ve never met any of them. Here in the city, nobody has any idea the rebellion even happened."
      - "You were a village priest. Births, deaths, rites of passage. Holy cow, was it boring. You renounced your vows and moved on.

Now you’re on the run hoping to lure the bandits away from home."

      - "Despite being cheerful and righteous, you can’t remember anything before you’re 25th birthday. Every time you kill something evil, you get a small memory back. Every quest returns to you a piece of your former self…and the more you see, the more you suspect you were not a good person."
      - "On a mission to buy some new clothes you were mistaken for an adventurer who had already orders some.

You then discovered the will and testament of your real parents and realize you are being raised by your uncle who controls all the family wealth. Fearful for your life and feeling betrayed you abandon the household to make your own name and find out what really happened to your parents. Your uncle may or may not know that you know about the deception."
      - "Once, you belonged into a wealthy and noble family, who unofficially ruled the city, due to your wealth and power. You were enjoying your time in the sun and were proud of your family name, until you discovered your father is a vampire, who works with evil necromancers and together turn civilians into monsters. Conflicted on your hatred, feelings of betrayal, sense of duty and love for your house, you grabbed your dearest friends and hit the road, forsaking your family name and keeping the secrets of your family hidden."

As you got older, they started teaching you the ways of the trade, and you planned to travel and trade with them your whole life.

Since then, you abandoned your dream, and have been making a living out of adventures."
      - "You were trained by a master of your skill, like many others, in an appropriate organisation. One day, they set each of the students on a quest for retrieving a mythical item. The thing your character was supposed to find though, was simply a myth. When you told the master the story, they didn’t believe you, and expelled you from the order."
      - "Your parents were retired adventurers, who told you their epic tales, and probably expected you to follow their steps. When you reached adulthood, you set out to do even more epic deeds than them, despite having no training at all."
      - "The first thing your remember is being rescued from rubble by a good-hearted noble, who then patched you up and offered his help in trying to find who you are. The only clue you have are your class abilities (which are like muscle memory to you), and the knowledge of whatever the collapsed building was."
      - "You grew up as a normal city kid, and never really did anything interesting with your life. You had a decent job and was going to get married soon, until the day you got lost in the wilderness. That was years ago, and you have never been able to find your way back to your hometown, because nobody seems to know about it."
      - "You grew up with nothing, cheating and stealing where you could. All you’ve ever earned was a target on your back and bad reputation. Eventually you found yourself on the run from the wrong kind of people. In a tavern you met a wizard that promised a way out. With nowhere else to turn, you reluctantly agreed. The wizard took you to his study and performed a ritual to switch your face with the face of another person of similar build. Now you go off into the world with a new identity and a chance to start over. Or so you thought… (The face you wear has it’s history too)."

Those in the caravan are your substitute family. You have several ‘grandparents,’ ‘aunts,’ ‘uncles,’ and ‘cousins.’ You took part in the caravan’s entertainment for coin, whether as a performer or someone behind the scenes. When you felt the need, you left the caravan of your own free will to pursue your journey. You were given a special crest with the performers’ symbol so you would be welcomed back if you returned."
      - "You are an experiment, either made or modified for a reason you cant even remember. with so many genetic changes and magical ‘enhancements’ that you cant even count the amount of places where they’re from. A lab rat from a man who seemed to want to do good, and claims to try to have done so but never told what he was doing specifically, never said what his end goal was and just kept going, and going and going.

You don’t know who you were, assuming you were anything other than this."
      - "You fell into life threatening trouble one day exploring some ruins close to town. There you found a strange altar with and old woman sitting behind it. She said she could help you escape, if you promise to serve her. You’re pretty sure she’s a god, but she won’t tell you her name, or what she’s the god of.

      - "You were once the son of a wealthy merchant who traveled more than average compared to other merchants at the time. Your father would often take you and your younger sister on some of his shorter journeys, exposing you to a dangers of sailing across the seas.

      - "You were once a wicked individual who took pleasure in the misery of others.

      - "You were a simple bed-and-breakfast inn owner. One of your guests left for a night of carousing and never returned. Among their left-behind possessions was an ornate locked box with no key.

Not knowing any better, you became strong with a smile. One evening, you showed kindness to an old woman who turned out to be a fairy queen in disguise. She blessed you with intelligence. Disgusted with the way you were treated, you left home, hoping to learn to read, study, and start life anew."

      - "The bandits thought they left nothing of value in your village, and maybe they were right because that night you lost your arm and way of life."
      - "You grew up as the region’s stereotype, a poor farmer with a passion for whittling. After inheriting the farm prospectors found gold in the river and you sold the farm for more money than you thought was in circulation. Unsure of how to spend money and unwilling to save it, you purchased an abandoned adventurer’s guild with plans to turn it into a wooden toy shop before finding it not quite as abandoned as you thought."

      - "You grew up watching the pit fighters in the capital city, marveling at their strength and ability. You spent years training on your own in both armed and hand fighting, with the ultimate goal of entering the pit and becoming a legend in your own right. As you are about to enter for your first match, your opponent and the announcer come over to lay out the match, revealing all of the fights are pre-determined and set up so no one is really injured. You walked away and now are trying to find your place in the world."
      - "For your entire life up to now you have watched others perform magic, they were few, but fantastical and filled your heart with wonder. Practice and study as you may, you were never able to recreate even simple cantrips that the local wizard has tried to teach you. Distraught, you ran to the woods to a secret clearing to cry for a bit. That day something incredible happens, magic shot from you fingertips, and shortly after a man in a suit and tie walk up from the edge of the clearing and sets his briefcase down on a large flat rock that you had never seen sitting there before. “It seems we have some paperwork to go over,” he said with a smile."

Unfortunately C was captured by the planets inhabitants and forced into slavery."
      - "You only remember the last 5-10 years of your live. Before that it is all blank. Your parents/caretakers/close ones tell you that you had a terrible accident and lost all memory after the accident. But then you find written agreements of your adoption, detailing that you were selected for an experimental form of adoption. This meant that your memory was wiped and your biological parents wiped out. You have been engineered by wizards/scientists to be the perfect human. You then find a note that the amnesia can be reversed if (plot hook) is done. A warning is written in big letters that reversing the amnesia spell might have unforeseen effects."
      - "You spent most of your childhood and early adulthood as a farmer, the difficulty of your daily work offset by the amazing times you’ve had with friends and family. One day, you hit your head on a rock. When you next awoke, you were in leather armor, on a sailing ship as part of an adventuring party. An entire life of adventure, riches, and excitement unfolded, and as you lay down for the last time, surrounded by your allies and loved ones, you woke back up with a pain in your temple, 3 seconds after hitting your head. You can’t feel comfortable any more as a farmhand, you need a blade in your hand and a bag of loot at your side."
      - "You’re a wandering conman, appearing trustworthy as you bend others around your finger, making yourself invaluable to them with the hard work and amazing success you provide. Every time you leave to fulfill your life’s dream of finding a perfect spouse, you leave behind a trail of heartbreak, impossible upkeep, and new businesses doomed to fail."
      - "You’d probably say that you’re about 605-615 now. The years go by in an instant. When you were young you devoted your life to meditation. Recently, you were visited by a boy, who you began to talk with, and would do anything for. He lived, trained with you, and eventually succumbed to age. You, now unquestionably ancient, you have no clue how to interact socially or succeed in anything else, but you want to see what world the boy left behind for you."
      - "You’ve spent your entire life underground, in the same building. Every day, a music box played you a lesson. You learned languages, numbers, history, how to act properly in society, how to assassinate the high king. Now, the doors finally open and you see the outside for the first time. It’s time to use all that you’ve learned."
      - "You’ve always been able to talk to the trees. They tell you interesting things. How they are, what they feel, how those who pass through and around them respect or disrespect them. Recently, the trees have been quieter and quieter. You need to find out why, for their sake… and yours."
      - "You were drunk. Your low marks in Thermo meant you wouldn’t be on the dean’s roll this semester. Your parents were going to lynch you. You spend the night weeping, stumbling into a dark part of campus you didn’t recognize. You made a deal. You thought they were going to intimidate your professor for you. You woke up in a hay bale, with no phone poles in sight. You get a strange feeling that you won’t be graduating this year."
      - "You were an orphan. Your parents died in a plague that went through when you were small and, to care for you, the town council apprenticed you to the local gravedigger. For years you served, learning the ins and outs of the physical and spiritual side of dealing with death. You learned about your god, the patron of death, from the gravedigger, but his worship always seemed a bit hollow, a little too rote. One night you picked up the sacred text he kept on the small shrine in your shared chambers and read it. You became shocked and dismayed at the disparity between the soft platitudes your guardian parrots and the dire truths uncovered in your god’s scriptures. That night the gravedigger, his home, your entire life burned to the ground as you set off to become the god of death’s most faithful servant ever."
      - "Born to caravan guards, as a child you traveled with merchants and learned to sort goods, haggle, fix wagons, spot danger, and cook meals on the road. You met all sorts of interesting people who paid to be guarded by a convoy. Now that you have come of age, you want to explore some of places you heard about."
      - "You are the 11th child of 14 siblings. Instead of hanging around your cramped home, you spent your waking hours in a nearby library, learning, sorting books, and doing sums for others for small fee you brought home to your parents. You have come of age and hope to write a book one day that will sell tens of thousands of copies."
      - "You were raised in a dragon’s den. One of your parents was a dragon’s favorite and the dragon allowed your family to take up residence in his/her home. They, and you once you were old enough, provided services such as greeting guests, expelling uninvited intruders, maintaining inventory, cleaning, and cooking fine meals. You have fond memories of playing in a piles of gold, stirring a 2000 gallon stew pot, donning magic clothing and weapons, leafing through esoteric books of powerful magic to look at the pictures, and attempting to outwit your draconic landlord with whatever puzzles and games you could think of. You left on good terms at the same time the dragon’s youngling left to establish its own territory, and you hope to carve out a bit of the world for yourself as well."
      - "You were raised in an abandoned necromancer’s lab by intelligent skeletons and various other undead. You ran a lot of errands, being tolerant of sunlight and unlikely to send the whole town fleeing for the hills. Your main mentor was a flamboyant skeleton with a hat of disguise and a penchant for long-winded but thrilling tales of ages past. Armed with ancient weapons, some minor alchemy materials, the lost necromancer’s notes, and the skills your undead family taught you, you now walk the earth. You are quite open-minded about creatures of the dark and undeath, but having seen the goodness they are capable of, you are intolerant of undead who would exist at the expense of others and visit cruelty on the living."
      - "You were born into a clan that viewed those born with magical power as evil. During your coming of age ceremony your powers awakened and you found yourself surrounded in arcane power. Fearful of you, the clan leader cast you out. Now you roam as an exile from your clan trying to understand your powers."
      - "Your birth was a summoning deep in the forest, and you recall the face of your first parental figure was sheer disappointment. Summoned as a readymade adult, your memory of childhood is non-existent, and less helpful, your summoner teleported away the moment you arrived nude on the mossy floor."
      - "You don’t remember your father at all, but your mother says that they were the most handsome and talented bard in all the land. Each day you wonder what adventures he must be on, as your village has nothing for you but chickens to pluck and hogs to hang. With nothing but pitchfork and hoe in hand you set out, determined to find your father, or at least bring back a story for the folks back home."
      - "Your father was a blacksmith, but he’s not truly your father. Your mother cheated on him years ago and he knows it. Whether it’s true or not you’ll never know. He hates you for it nonetheless. He did the bare minimum a father needed to do until you were old enough then kicked you out despite your mother’s plea’s. You stole the greataxe(or preferred weapon) he was withholding until the customer paid and left your old life behind."
      - "You were orphaned at the church of (insert God of Strength, War, Valor here) where you were raised from a young age to become a fierce warrior for your God."
      - "When you were young, you had a thing for fire. It was pretty, destructive, and alluring. One night as your family slept you were playing with it and accidentally set the family home ablaze. Your mother awoke to the inferno and using every once of power she had saved you from the blaze before succumbing and burning up right in front of your eyes. It was the most beautiful thing you ever saw, and if only the world understood, then maybe they wouldn’t be so afraid of fire."
      - "Mistress tells you that you used to be a great Paladin. A sworn warrior of good, bringing justice and light to a terrible land. Then you came to her and Mistress may be the strongest enchantress there is, maybe stronger. Now you are Mistress’s defender, a (insert Warforged, Golem here)."
      - "You are … were a member of the city watch. Now, you suppose that you’ve likely lost that position. Just like your father, you were signed up and joined their ranks at quite a young age. You were far too low of a rank to call your job fulfilling or exciting, but you didn’t really mind it all that much. After work you’d spend about half a day’s pay drowning your boredom in booze. You’ve always had a love for a good brew, but you never thought it much of a problem. Until recently. It seems one night you decided to go on a week long binge. What few memories you have are too fuzzy and disorienting to make any sense of. How you’re alive, you don’t know. During your blackout, you seem to have somehow made it to somewhere you don’t even recognize. You’re wearing equipment you don’t remember acquiring. You accidentally set off a cantrip, despite the fact you’ve never even seen magic at work, let alone use it.

Her blade looks like shit and has been in her family for seventy generations, but a trained magical eye can see that it’s a blade of dragon slaying.

As a sidekick, Klaura travels with a small light-fairy in a lantern. The fairy can only speak sylvan (which Klaura cannot).

And now they travel. She sits on the fancy flying carpet that hangs over his back, and he wears a snow cap (the kind with the dangly fuzz balls) that allows him to resist fire damage.

This usually ends with him leaving empty villages behind, believing himself to be the only one to survive the undead horde."
      - "Kari Brooke – Demon hunter from Ogura. She was a samurai for a wealthy man before he was murdered by a demon in cold blood. She fled the capital instead of committing seppuku, believing that her job was not quite done. And it won’t be done until she finds the demon who did it and beheads him. Until then, all the other demons will have to do."
      - "Captain Pit – Retired Saint called back to duty for a special mission. He and his crew of mercenaries sailed his ship up a river into the Everwood to see how far it would go. Things happened. Strange things. Now he and his crew pillage and burn villages they come across. They send letters back to Ogura smeared in blood. Dragon Knight Lance has put a bounty on Pit himself."
      - "Saint Suffer – An icy-blue haired knight, a Ghost. Her body is cold like the dead, undetectable by any sort of heat vision. Her blade is so cold that it shatters other blades on contact (natural 20). Anywhere she goes the temperature drops several degrees. She is a crusader for Suffering and visits villages in the Everwood to gather apostles and spread the religion."
      - "Kel – Drow ranger. He fled the dark side of the moon to hunt an atomic dragon that crashed down into the Everwood. But finding something in the Everwood is never as simple as it seems. Kel has been searching for 15 years and has joined a Lookout group. He hunts with them."
      - "Drear – Half Demon Elf, cursed with the presence of a dark spirit. Her Oni never wanders far from her and reacts violently to even the most harmless move. She lives in her village even though it’s been burned to the ground in an attempt to kill her. She cannot burn, she cannot die, she cannot leave."
      - "Fae – Witch of the Fireflies. Everyone knows that fireflies are powerful spirits. They are the promises broken, the secrets unkept. They exist in two worlds at once and flutter with the light that slowly drips out of them into nothing. Fae has learned to capture them, and as we all know, to hold something is to wield it. Wherever she goes, awe-inspiring feats of good and evil follow."
      - "The Minotaur and his Bride – Prick and Bruise travel the Everwood looking for a certain piece of treasure. If you find yourself seeking mystical books, you might find them. The book they seek will unbind them from their promise and allow them to live their own lives. As of now, their fates are entwined. His blood is in her veins, and he is kept alive by the red gem she welded to his forehead."
      - "Dark Kindred – A child spirit, harbinger of premature death. The spirit lurks wherever a child has died, looking for their lost and frightened spirit to help guide them away to safety. If you see her look away. Only speak to her if she has asked you to. And never, ever let her eyes meet yours. There are things in those orbs that no mortal can bear."
      - "Azinga – This white-haired spirit lurks where color has faded. She brings with her color and with that color comes violence. She is a volatile and unpredictable spirit. She likes to watch people fight over petty things and she loves watching a village crumble under its own jubilous hatred. Only a good fight to the death can clean a village of her presence."
      - "Kraken – Adventurer of the spirit world. Travels with her cosmic owl and her death hound, her red robe grants her etherealness, her blade cuts the most unhuman of foes. She is not a friend of spirits and they aren’t a friend of her. But she is searching for one spirit that was taken long ago. Her own. A demon stole it and cursed her with a life of unluck and miasma. If she can find it and slay the demon, perhaps she can be normal."
      - "Gauntel – Excommunicated druid, despiser of all things convenient and currently walking the path of suffering. At the end he hopes to find the snow wolves that haunt the monastery. He hopes to defeat them and enter the monastery. Once inside he will either find spiritual enlightenment, or kill them all."
      - "Patricia Whin – Knight of Who Cares. Mistress of Not Giving a Fuck. Damsel that brings distress. Umbrella in the sun, pale skin painted geisha white, kimono robe several sizes too large, her brother’s sword (she’s “watching it for him, he’ll be back soon”) ornate in lilies and rose pedals. She has jars of alchemical concoctions that she passes off as potions, and a small spirit token that dotes after her. She doesn’t want anything. Leave her alone."
      - "Simon – Cleric of the Red Dragon Pellimore. Has undergone a forbidden ritual to turn himself into a dragon. It worked, partially. He’s human, but has scales of a dragon, claws of a dragon, a tail like a dragon, and a pair of useless dragon wings. He cannot breath fire. He is not a dragon born. But he is a terrifying site to behold. He says he can turn others into dragons with the right ritual…"
      - "Naka – Spirit hunter, with her dog Okam (white Siberian with red rituals painted on his fur). She travels the forest looking for the spirit that stole her village from her. Sbe trades her spirit knowledge for favors, which usually include gathering special materials, performing spiritual rituals, or helping her take down an unruly spirit."
      - "Thundar – Saint gone psycho. He wear black jeans, white shirt, black leather jacket. His long black hair always falls over his eyes. He’s grizzled and wields a machete. Castle wants him dead, but even though he’s a psycho he doesn’t harm humans. He sprints through the forest delivering his own tribunals for creatures and wrong-doers. The innocent lose a hand. The guilty lose their heads."
      - "Syban – A prince from Ogura. He can split himself into four identical copies, each masters of their own weapon of choice (bow, spear, sword, whip). They can travel apart from each other and Syban can hear and see through all of them. His health is divided among them and when one is slain, all other copies can feel it. He was banished from Ogura."
      - "Eyra Churn – Human ambassador to the Moon. Raised in Aberdeen, she took a job as the Queen’s assistant for the sole reason of opening communications with the Moon. After the Queen relented, Eyra claimed her spot as emissary and makes weekly trips to the moon. Why is she in the Everwood? Something brought her ship down and she’s never been more afraid."
      - "Theen Elyse – Queen of the Cursed Mock, Blind Prophet, Hearer of all that crawl. One of the Theens of the cursed wood, Elyse is colorless (black and white), fourteen feet tall, and an elf. Her curse has manifested itself as a stable wormhole on her forehead."

Her barbaric rage is magnified beyond normal capabilities. Her job: deal with the orc tribes that are moving in from the badlands. She prefers violence."
      - "Stalker – Ranger of the Hidden Leaf, half-elf, and dragon hunter. Stalker has been sent on a mission to track down a dragon that ravaged a village under Lookout protection. He’s mute after a run in with a revenant. He’s not looking for help tracking the dragon, but that doesn’t mean he won’t accept it."
      - "Gabriel – A girl who was stolen by spirits at birth and returned to her parents after 10 years. She has eyes like space, and gazing into them allows whatever is inside to gaze back. When she wants it to, the map etched onto the skin of her face and neck can appear. She knows that it leads to the spirit world. She doesn’t want anyone else to go there."

    entries:
      - "The Allfather – Ruler of the gods and creator of humans and other races."
      - "Război – One of two gods of war. Although often seen as bloodthirsty, he actually hates war. He encourages brutality so that people will fear war and try to avoid it."
      - "Erou – One of two gods of war. Generally the more worshipped of the two, being seen as the goddess of honorable war. Loves the thrill of battle and she appreciates it most when her worshippers fight battles in her name."
      - "Nälij – Goddess of knowledge. Legend says she lives in an eternal archive with the knowledge of all that does, has, or will exist."
      - "Rymat Samiar – Demigod of bridges, ferryboats, and fjords. Samiar was born a mortal who later achieved great renown for his swordplay, trickery, and legendary ability to escape from the most secure prisons in the multiverse. His most famous exploit was escaping from the afterlife by transforming into a frog and swimming back across the Stream of Life. He tricked the Servitor of Death sent to retrieve him to make a bargain that he would protect others from mishaps when fording the Stream if he could remain free. Now he is invoked by those wishing a safe crossing across rivers and streams. He usually appears as a rapier-wielding bipedal frog."
      - "Ismaros – God of stalking. The hooded figure looks a bit like the grim reaper, but without being a skeleton. He is not very popular, but he is always there, always watching everyone and everything. If you wish to make a deal with him for information, it will come at a great price."
      - "Edrun-Of-Far-Places – God of the unknown and the wanderer, dressed in a traveler’s cloak patterned with stars. He has no realm in the Astral Plane and instead is believed to wander the mortal realm."
      - "Talichtoli – God of Murder, justified or unjustified. Talichtoli’s symbol is a simple bone knife, and they gives their aid to any who truly wants someone dead."
      - "Pocaba, Lady of Islands – Goddess of sailors, fishermen and any who lives away from the mainland."
      - "Hornfels – Dwarven god of home and hearth. It is common for members of any faith to keep a statue of Hornfels on the mantle. This god demands no worship, no tradition. Warming yourself by his protected hearth or eating food cooked at his hearth offers a kind of boon over the years. A request for home and safety can be made. Locate an outcrop of rock and, using soot from a campfire, draw a door-frame on the stone or boulder. The door-handle is drawn with a special rune. If done correctly and by the right person the door will materialize and a hearth and bed will be waiting inside the stone."
      - "Fýsi – Goddess of the reclaiming wilds. When disaster strikes a town and buildings or lives are lost, that is the work of Fýsi, she takes back the man-made. Followers of Fýsi are nomadic and travel between villages on the outskirts of the wilds. Followers of Fýsi are not so much protected by her, or sent by her for specific bidding, but rather understand that Fýsi will act and it is a question of disaster, or a safe offering. They understand that Fýsi acts to protect nature and her disasters are akin to the lashing out of a scared animal, when her home is encroached by mankind. Followers are often offered respite in abandoned buildings in the village. Often, disaster can be warded off when followers arrive at the village and suggest safe homes and objects to offer to nature, so that disaster can be averted. Rangers and hunters will seek out these followers for blessing to avoid animal attacks and other dangers of the wild. A common ward is a packet of seeds kept in a cloth pouch with dry earth from their village. As long as the traveler keeps the soil dry, they will be safe."
      - "Calais – God of vigilance and domesticity. Domain: Life/Light Calais is not the most powerful or well-known god, but among the pantheons he is the most well-loved. Keeper of homesteads and of vigils he comforts the wives whose husbands have gone off to war and keeps hope alive in the hearts of men who are in far off and possibly dark places. Although his representation among clergy has diminished over time, he keeps the hearth alive and warm for all mankind."
      - "Noklaji – The Construction god, representing the expansion of cities and towns. This gnomish god is a deep gray all over and always carries a wooden plank with a nail in it as his weapon. Protects buildings and the people inside."
      - "Vigo – Faceless Prince, Master of Lies, Patron God of Actors and Charlatans. Shapeshifter, Facechanger, the Great Mimic. Has no temples but a yearly festival where a parade of masked worshippers marches through cities. His holy symbol is a plain gold coin with two eyeholes, but any mask can be used to depict him."
      - "The Crone – Goddess of Mists, Magic and Prophecy. Worshipped primarily by the river halfling nomads, she is a little known deity and very mysterious. It is said these Halflings read the cards each morning to determine her will for them, and that her chosen on this earth (often an elderly female seer), is imparted with some of her divine manifestation."
      - "Samuqan – God of the Desert, Sun and Stars. He is known as a god of little mercy because of what he did to the land, but also as a guide for people, using the stars to help travellers find their way and tell their history."
      - "Sangasu – God of Storms, known as a destructive force of nature, but necessary for renewal. It is believed he kidnapped (Goddess) and forced her to help him make monsters."
      - "Naphistim – God of the Sea and Sand, people worship him when they need to travel through harsh and unforgiving places. They often give thanks to him by way of sacrifice as a reminder of their mortality, but also their strength."
      - "Mezizi – God of Time and Death. All things turn to dust and sand, many are burnt in funeral pyres to honour him as it is he who allows life even in the harsh climes of the deserts and wastes."
      - "Lugalme – Goddess of War and Fire. This goddess is the heat of passion and bloodlust, embodied literally as fire, she is prayed to in times of tragedy but also renewal, consummation and of course, before war."
      - "Amarazen – God of Protection and Life, she is said to be the one that guided (city’s founder) to the oasis that made (Desert city) possible. Those who anger her are given visions of water that isn’t real. Most claim her essence rests in the oasis and so the largest temple belongs to to her as she allowed them to live at the oasis’ side. Thus all who wish to take from the waters must pay tithes to the temple. She is secretly the goddess of secrets and sacred knowledge."
      - "Elutil – Goddess of Monsters, Madness and Evil. Often depicted as an elderly woman, Elutil is cursed and hated by the people as the mother of Hags. Thought to have created most of the monsters in the world, it is hate and fear that strengthens her."
      - "Delondra – Goddess of Woe and False hope, but at the centre of her machinations is the promise of something greater. She is a fickle Goddess, known to test mortals, sometimes out of sadistic humor and sometimes from a desire to help. She is also a Goddess of Hope and Risk."
      - "Toitel – God of Travel, Wandering and Beasts. It is said he walks the world and has no domain other than where he stops to rest each night. He carries a shell on his back that looks like a rock to hide from people. Those who find him, he blesses with luck."
      - "Caileon Le Corre – God of Protection, Music and Joy. He was sad to be a human who saved thousands from disaster and so was worshipped by them. He is depicted with a ring of swords and a lute. In times of revelry, some say they can hear his voice, keeping the party alive."

      - "Michizane – patron god of learning. Often students will pray or provide offering ahead of a major exam. He is known to be fond of poetry, plums and oxen. Legend tells of the time a nobleman closed down a library, to expand his palace. Misfortune had befallen the nobleman and his family, until they reopened the library and built a shrine in his honor. His holy symbol resembles a plum tree."
      - "Molac – God of Flame, Red Dawn, Flame Tyrant. The god of the primal wild nature of fire. He represents chaos, and that is passionate (love, art, war. etc…). He appears as a being made from flame bearing a mask made of blackened wood. He represents things that are all consuming and destructive."
      - "Tempsdule: God of time – Born out of the fragmentation of Relatitus, former Deity of The Singularity, Temspdule lives in a temple on the Moon, guarding and manipulating the Universal Hourglass, that controls all time in the Multiverse."
      - "Metria – Goddess of space – Also born from Relatitus, Metria dwells on a mile-high tower on the Sun, which she moves and protects, using it to coordinate the movement of the planes."
      - "Decepscher – God of illusion – Worshipped by illusion mages, Decepscher is often depicted as an artist, using a canvas and paint to shape the perception of reality. It’s said he lives in a personal semi-plane, where all normal concepts of space and time are irrelevant."
      - "Aveli – Deity of birds – Once a majestic winged creature that soared through the skies of the old world, it created all the bird species, and sacrificed it’s own flying abilities in favor of it’s creation. Penguins and emus are a question Aveli refuses to answer it’s followers."
      - "Falkorta – Goddess of luck – Ironically, she’s worshipped by strategists and leaders, who believe chance plays a huge role in any important event. She decides who to give her blessings, and does so to anyone, just to make it look like she’s neutral, even though she prefers to bring luck to those who never give up. Usually takes the form of a small pink dragon."
      - "Icholese – The Lady of the Lake, the Teal Stream. Godess of lakes, rivers, and all inland waters. She protects the health of her people by granting them pure water and healings. She can take the form of a great predatory fish or a willow. Her fidels often throw offerings in ponds and ritualistically drown sacrifices"
      - "Doran – The God of the Forge. He is a Dwarf with a mighty hammer in hand and towers even Orcs in size. It is said that the unique weapons that Dwarves use come from Doran telling them how to make it when they sleep. These same legends say the weapons are to have a greater purpose in the future against an unknown enemy."
      - "Bob – God of the mundane."
      - "Peolai – Goddess of luck. Big on irony, she tends to make life chaotic for those people most staunchly committed to our ability to control our own destiny. On the other hand, for those who rely upon luck and appease her, their good fortune becomes almost predictable."
      - "Lelia – One of the twin druid gods, Lelia is the opposite of Vadaszat. Called the Mother of Nature, the owl-headed goddess represents life and balance in nature. She and Vadaszat select a shared mortal champion from among their druids, called the Skinwalker."
      - "Vadaszat – The second of the twin druid gods, Vadaszat the Huntmaster is the brutality and ruthlessness of nature made manifest. Appearing as a man with a deer head, he stalks the world’s forests at night hunting prey for sport."
      - "Aussiria – Goddess to Kobolds, Dragonborn, and other races with draconic heritage. It is said she was born a pure white color, and emanated a powerful good aura unlike her brothers and sisters. Unlike other chromatic dragons, she values kindness and well being over power and hatred. Draconic societies that worship her are therefore very welcoming with their hospitality to outsiders, though they are not against using claw and breath to maintain the sanctity of their homes."
      - "God of the Forgotten – you know how sometimes you wash your laundry and sometimes you end up missing a few socks? They’re his now. Orphanages hold a special place in his heart, and any legends, stories, or prophecies lost to time are his to know."
      - "God of Belief – If an “AllFather” or “God of Creation”, or “King of Gods” had an origin story, it would be because of this god. Following through on superstitions (like knocking on wood, or throwing salt over your left shoulder) is worship to him, and as this God is of Belief, he is able to create new Gods–which may or may not be properly thankful for their creation (e.g. “Oh hero, it is because of your belief that I am alive! Here is a boon.”). His true form cannot be seen by anyone, as anyone who sees him sees what they believe he looks like."
      - "Goddess of Choices – Much like her sister the Goddess of Luck, this goddess is more on the “cosmic” scale of things. Able to see other outcomes for different choices–and depending on the outcome of the choice and whether or not you are in her favor, she may let you choose the more fortunate path. Alternatively, if you piss her off, she may send you down the more destructive path–even if it seemingly looks like the best path, at the moment. She is fond of games that require logic or math."
      - "Goddess of Elements – not just of water, nor solely of fire, air, or earth–and certainly not “mother nature”. “Element” golems worship her, as it is she who grants them life. She has a particular fondness of fire and lava–or, really, any of the “heated” elements. Being a high priest in her temple means remaining virginal–she rewards loyalty with immunities."
      - "The Gray God – A solitary genderless god, half pure evil and half pure good, both sides are eternally in pain from the others’ existence. Worship at their feet means relief of pain from it’s existence, and with relief brings information that Good can use against Evil–as well as information Evil can use against good (both pieces of information are given at the same time to the one worshiping). Also could be considered a god of wealth, the Gray God also finds pain relief in donations of silver coins (melted in sacrifice). The larger the donation, the more your alignment slides towards True Neutral."
      - "Goddess of the Gift – any time something is given selflessly, or out of good will to another is worship to her. Fun fact: any version of “Santa Claus” on any version of reality is her champion. Usually “appears” to those who have great potential but are in dire straits–she isn’t ever actually seen, mind you, but something draws her target to whatever gift she’s left behind. Typically, her gift is contextual in nature."
      - "The Write/ReWrite God – authors/bards pray to him, their worship is books/songs, his temples are libraries/music halls. This god looks like… well, like a shut-in middle-aged male with a pencil on his ear, glasses down his nose, and rumpled up dark-brown hair with silver streaks on either side. If your adventure, your quest, whatever mission you’re on, is not going well… you pray to this god, and hope he doesn’t find your story exciting. If your downturn of events makes for a good book, he will ignore you, and may even possibly send more challenges your way; but if you seem unjustly getting the wrong end of the stick (so to speak), he will erase what’s happened, and re-write it so you come out better."
      - "Spencer – God of storytelling and beards."
      - "Vance – the god of deceit, mischief, and insanity. Represented by a smiling gray mask. He blesses those who worship him with insanity and power. On the occasion that he comes to the material world, or a follower gains his spirit, he tends to go to casinos and bet everything he has on him. When losing, he burns the place to the ground. He is known to take any bet, whatever the chances."
      - "Judrod – Goddess of lost causes. Taking the form of a brief spark of light, this goddess is known to appear when all seems lost. A flash in the eyes of a sickly child just before a miraculous recovery, a glint off a rock that momentarily blinds an executioner, a meteor in the sky that leads a starving man out of the forest: all these are manifestations of her brief favor. Impossible to prove from mere coincidence, her boons are nonetheless real."
      - "Paxe – the god of peaceful passings. Taking the form of a kindly stranger, this god will appear at the side of those dying in pain or in fear and will comfort them until they claimed by Death. Paxe will grant blessings on those that nurse the sick or comfort the troubled. Necromancers and torturers earn the god’s wrath, as Paxe will reveal in harsh detail to them how they will die."
      - "Fortuna – goddess of luck and gambling that celebrates fair play. She will never alter the outcome of a game of chance, but will often grant boons to those that willingly risk everything. Appearing as a smiling beauty with fire red hair, she might gift a gracious loser at a casino with a priceless ruby or a winner at a card game with a passionate kiss. Those that cheat at games of chance, though, earn her wrath and instead see her moments before meeting a grusome end in a random accident."
      - "Azuiar – Secret god of preservation. On the surface, Azuiar is a god of evil, the proverbial devil on your shoulder convincing you to do bad things. In reality he chose to adopt the mantle of the evil god out of fear that the world was changing too drastically toward good. Azuiar is the god of all who wish to corrupt and do evil for its own sake."
      - "Entaros – God of the Soil- A massive giant ridden with dirt, grass, and plant life. Many say he is made of stone himself, with a heart of diamond. Legend has it, the most rich soil is that which clings to his back, and that those who worship him will be granted with the ability to grow all plants in any location. He rests in the earth, appearing to be a huge overgrown mountain. Many druids and those who respect nature are his followers."
      - "Knaben – God of archeologists and ruins, he guides those who seek lost knowledge. Mostly invoked to protect graves and monuments from grave robbers, buildings blessed by him are immune to the wear of the elements, at least until someone recovers their secrets."
      - "Ub’took – God of Aliens: A disliked loner of a god that has taken an interest in mindflayers, beholders, and other aberrant creatures. Most aberrations stick don’t worship him or even acknowledge his existence but Ub’took does have a small following. He is also a patron of all mortals who study alien lore and magic."
      - "Nurggle – God of the unclean. Nurggle thrives on the rot and decay of all things as he and his followers see it being the common denominator of everything. Nurggles avatar is the form of a Giant/Orc hybrid with the broken antlers of an elk. He wishes for the decay of not just physical entities but also society, love/purity in relationships, and advancement. His followers often douse townsfolk with their chamberpots and exhume corpses in the name of Nurggle. Nurggle only appears to mortals when they have destroyed or desecrated something of great sentimental worth, when he reveals himself he will complete one task for a mortal so long as it is vile and distasteful. No Lawful or good alignments would worship this deity."
